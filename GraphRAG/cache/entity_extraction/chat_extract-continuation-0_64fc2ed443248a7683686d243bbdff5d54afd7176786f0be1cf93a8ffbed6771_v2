Thanks for the recommendations! Nice talking to you :D | Recommender: And of course he stars in it | Recommender: Nice talking to you as well!\nRecommender: Hi! | Recommender: What sort of movies do you like? | User: I really enjoy drama/biography.  For example I enjoyed Phantom Thread (2017) | Recommender: Oh, that's a movie I haven't seen. If you like Drama, I really enjoyed Allied (2016) recently. | User: I think that's on my list to see.  Did you see The Darkest Hour  (2011) ? | Recommender: Yes it was fab! I also really enjoyed Dunkirk  (2017) - I haven't watched the original yet, but it is on my list. | Recommender: Have you seen Dunkirk  (2017) ? | User: That should have been Darkest Hour  (2017) | Recommender: Do you enjoy war movies? | User: Yes, loved Dunkirk  (2017)   I really want to see 12 Strong (2018) I didn't see it in the theater because the reviews weren't all that great | Recommender: I do like the classics.. I can recommend Ice Cold in Alex (1958) and Battle of Britain  (1969) for a Sunday afternoon marathon. | Recommender: I've not seen 12 Strong (2018) - I will have to check it out. | User: One of my favorite films was The Hurt Locker (2008) | Recommender: Jodie Foster? | Recommender: I don't think I've seen it... | User: Oh, you'd like it!  Gotta go watch some movies now. | Recommender: Is it similar to Panic Room (2002)? | User: bye | Recommender: Yes me too! Nice to talk with you :)\nUser: Hi--I'm looking for a good ghost story | Recommender: Ah! Okay.. let's see.... | User: Maybe something set in the past | Recommender: There are the classics, like The Shining  (1980) and The Sixth Sense (1999) | User: I liked both of those!  I also liked The Others  (2001) | Recommender: The Shining  (1980) is the early 80s... which I guess is the past now... Jeez, I feel old lol | Recommender: I have not seen The Others  (2001) | User: Right?  Me too :). | User: I also like some of the Japanese horror movies that have ghosts | Recommender: It's not a ghost story, but it is a good horror flick set in the past... Mary Reilly  (1996) is about Dr. Jekyl's maid. | User: Oh, wow!  That sounds really interesting. | User: I like costume dramas, so that sounds perfect | Recommender: It is! very different. It has Julia Roberts and John Malkovich. | User: What about anything else sort of like that? | Recommender: I like costume dramas as well, and Mary Reilly  (1996) has a ton of costumes. Corsets and brocade everywhere | Recommender: Bram Stoker's Dracula (1992) is very well done. Set in the victorian era, very well directed and photographed. | User: Nice!  Picnic at Hanging Rock (1975) is one of my favorites, too | Recommender: Mary Shelley's Frankenstein  (1994) is cheesy but fun, and it is heavy on the costumes and scenery. | User: I've seen Bram Stoker's Dracula (1992) and I loved the costumes in that, too | Recommender: Gary Oldman has some pretty fabulous looks going on in that one for sure. | User: Still haven't seen Mary Shelley's Frankenstein  (1994) , but I need to put that back on my radar.  Thanks for the suggestion!\nRecommender: Hi! What is your favourite movie? | User: I really like war movies like Darkest Hour  (2017) | Recommender: Me too! Have you seen Dunkirk  (2017) ? | Recommender: I haven't seen the original yet though. | User: yes, and I loved it!  I also really like The Hurt Locker (2008) | Recommender: I've not seen that one. I'll check it out. | Recommender: I can recommend some old school movies too... have you seen Ice Cold in Alex (1958) ? | Recommender: Or Escape to Victory (1981) ? | User: I haven't seen that one or that one either.  I will put them on my list.  I want to see 12 Strong (2018) | Recommender: Yes that one looks interesting. I also like things like Inglourious Basterds (2009) | User: Nope, not that one either.  Inglourious Basterds (2009) was terrific. | Recommender: Although you need a strong stomach for that one! | Recommender: Well, we both now have some other movies we can add to our 'to watch' list! | Recommender: Nice chatting to you! | User: bye\nUser: Hi!
