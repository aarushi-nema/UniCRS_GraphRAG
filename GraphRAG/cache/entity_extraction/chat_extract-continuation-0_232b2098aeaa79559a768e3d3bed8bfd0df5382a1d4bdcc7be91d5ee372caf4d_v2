If they fail, they're turned into an animal of their choosing. This is one of those films that people will either love, or absolutely loathe. But to me, it's a classic. Made by Yorgos Lanthimos, the same man who gave us the disturbing Dogtooth, The Lobster is in a way an extreme mirror to as dark a romantic film can get. | Recommender: or if you are okay with subtitles there is The Science of Sleep (2006) | Recommender: also foreign is The Beauty Inside  (2015) | User: oh wow i havent heard of any of these! | Recommender: great, | User: that first one definitely sounds like something i would watch | Recommender: I hope those help | Recommender: if you want a classic, there is always Sleepless in Seattle (1993) | User: such a good one! | User: thanks for the suggestions have a good night\nUser: hi! | Recommender: Hi | User: i am looking for some movies to watch during a night in with some friends! any genres welcome but comedies would be top! | Recommender: Have you seen Thor: Ragnarok (2017) ?
