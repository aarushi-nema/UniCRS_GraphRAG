I loved that movie when I was a child. I'll have to watch that one then. | User: The grown up version I guess! | Recommender: Yes because the story is already written so they can just focus on the other elements. | Recommender: Yes it is a grown up version with live action instead of cartoon. | User: Sounds good. Thank you for the suggestion! | Recommender: Your welcome. Hope I helped. | User: Yes! Have a good night! Bye!\nUser: Hey! | Recommender: Hi! | Recommender: What kind of movies to you like? | User: Anything with Mel Gibson or Harrison Ford. | Recommender: Both are very talented! Have you seen The Fugitive  (1993) with Harrison Ford? | User: I have seen the Lethal Weapon  and Star Wars movies. | User: No I haven't. Is it any good? | Recommender: Yes. It is my favorite of his. He is a medical doctor whose wife gets murdered. He is blamed for it and is on death row. He escapes and tries to figure out who murdered his wife. Tommy Lee Jones is the FBI agent after him. | Recommender: You should watch it sometime! | User: Sounds interesting! | User: I will! | Recommender: Have you seen The Patriot  (2000) with Mel Gibson? | User: I heard of it and may have seen pieces of it but I'm not positive. | Recommender: It's a good watch. Mel Gibson does not want to get involved in the Revolutionary war, but ends up getting very involved since things happen to his family. It's a very good movie too. | User: I think I have seen bits of it. | User: Sounds familiar. | Recommender: It's really good. He is very good in that movie. | Recommender: I hope you get to watch those sometime! Have a good night! | User: You too. Thank you and goodbye! | Recommender: Bye!\nRecommender: Hi there! | User: Hello | Recommender: What kind of movies do you like? | User: I like action movies | User: Any suggestions ? | Recommender: What are some of your favorites? | User: Well , Die Hard (1988) , Taken  (2008) and The Matrix (1999) | User: Have you seen any of them ? | User: They are really good | Recommender: Yes! I've seen them all!

I have seen Man on a Ledge (2012). | Recommender: Alright, that's a great film too! | User: A spy drama like True Lies (1994) also sounds good. | Recommender: I would recommend Phone Booth  (2002) for sure, as well as The Sixth Sense (1999). True Lies (1994) was awesome! Let me think of something similar to that | Recommender: Have you seen Body of Lies  (2008) yet? | User: I have not heard of that. | Recommender: Not exactly the same as True Lies (1994) but worth the watch, and similar enough I think! | Recommender: Hopefully those will be some good additions to your list ;) | Recommender: Also, because it's on my mind... Patriot Games  (1992) is a must watch in my opinion ;) | User: I dont think I have seen that one either. | User: Thank you for all your suggestions. I just have to make a decision. | Recommender: Alright, well you're welcome!\nUser: Hi! | Recommender: Hello.

(2003) and Inspector Gadget  (1999) | User: Nice, I'm glad to hear that! | Recommender: I haven't seen any of those! | Recommender: Have you seen The Italian Job  (2003) ? Its kind a mix of both. | User: Well definitely check them out!
