It was good | User: I was surprised how good it was because of the director and his history | Recommender: What's that about? | Recommender: Who's the director? | Recommender: It's not creepy like you'd think. It's really sad because most of the people were molested growing up so they associate it as being the norm. | User: M.Night Shamalyn.  He made The Sixth Sense (1999) Unbreakable  (2000) Signs  (2008) and a couple other horrible movies | User: but Split (2017) is good. Its about Three girls are kidnapped by a man with a diagnosed 23 distinct personalities.
