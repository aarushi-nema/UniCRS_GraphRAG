And also in The Final Cut  (2004) | User: I wasn't a fan of Patch Adams  (1998) though. broke my heart | Recommender: I know. That one made me sad, too. | User: I do like comedies too if you'd rather suggest that | Recommender: Yeah, I'm more into older movies, so it's hard for me to come up with recent films.
