In that case, I would recommend Superbad  (2007) . It's a bit old, but I enjoy it. | Recommender: I'd also suggest The 40-Year-Old Virgin (2005) with Steve Carrell (sp) | User: Those are great recommendations! | Recommender: Thanks! | Recommender: Glad I'm helping. :) | User: I think i'll try the one with Steve Carrell | User: Thanks for the suggestions. Happy Holidays | Recommender: Happy Holidays!\nRecommender: Good evening! | User: Hey. | User: Hi! | User: Could you recommend a good Thriller. | User: Prisoners  (2013)  and Taking Lives  (2004) are some of my favorites | User: I normally watch dark thrillers. | Recommender: In that case, you'll probably love The Snowman  (2017) with Michael Fassbender. It's like Red Dragon  (2002) but a little more gore. | User: That one sounds great. I heard a lot of good things about that one. | Recommender: I would also recommend Wind River  (2017) with Jeremey Rener. It's about a murder mystery on an indian reservation. Pretty dark and psychological. | User: I think I'll try it out tonight. | Recommender: It kind of reminds me of Mystic River  (2003) if you've ever seen it. | User: I love Jeremy Rener. Thanks for the suggestions. | User: Merry christmas\nUser: hi | Recommender: Hello! | Recommender: Happy New Year! | User: Happy new year, I am looking for a good thriller movie | User: Something like Seven  (1995) | Recommender: I've got just the film! | Recommender: Have you seen Split (2017) with James Macavoy? | Recommender: It's like @Seven but not as gory. | User: I love movies with crazy twists. I have seen it!! I loved it | User: i also loved Double Jeopardy  (1999) with Ashley jUDD | Recommender: Now that I think of it, Suspect Zero (2004) with Ben Kingsly is more like Seven  (1995) | User: I've never seen it, what is it about? | Recommender: Crazy twists you say? Then you'd definitely want to check out Twisted  (2004) with Jolie and Sam Jackson. | User: I have never even heard of that movie, but I love Angelina Jolie! | Recommender: Suspect Zero (2004) is a cat and mouse film where a detective is trying to track down and apprehend a serial killer who goes by suspect zero | User: I think I will watch that one, it sounds like something i would love, thank you so much! | User: Have a great day!\nRecommender: Hi! | Recommender: What movie are you looking for? | User: Hi there. | User: I'm in the mood for a good horror film this evening. | User: Something like the classic slasher films from the 80s. | Recommender: The Green Inferno  (2013) is a good gorey film | User: What's that about? | User: Or what is it similar to? | Recommender: It's about theses students that go visit a village to protest the abuse, but they end up on an island where the tribe does cannibalism. It's very gorey.Or there is always the classic A Nightmare on Elm Street (1984) | Recommender: Or another old school movie is Silent Night, Deadly Night (1984) | User: Can never go wrong with Freddy. :) | User: And the inferno film sounds like it might give my girlfriend the creeps. I'll see if Amazon has it for rental. :) | Recommender: Or the other classic Friday the 13th  (1980)  or It  (1966) | Recommender: Perfect! hope you enjoy it! | User: I've seen Silent Night, Deadly Night Part 2 (1987) . But not the first. | Recommender: The first one is a lot better than the sequel | User: So I've heard. But that shouldn't surprise me. The originals are always better. | User: Unless it's a sequel done by James Cameron, then all bets are off. :D | Recommender: Ha I so true, I love his films | Recommender: Well hope you like the suggestions, have a great day!\nRecommender: Hi! | User: hi | Recommender: What sorts of movies can I recommend for you tonight? | Recommender: I'm quite the movie buff. :) | User: Perfect! | User: I am looking for some good thriller movies | User: Like psychological thrillers | User: ISomething similar to Seven  (1995) and High Crimes (2002) | Recommender: Okay. In that case I would recommend Primal Fear  (1996) with Richard Gere and Edward Norton. | User: I love Edward Norton, what is that movie about&gt; | Recommender: I'd also recommend The Zodiac  (2005) with Jake Gylenhall. (sp) | User: I did enjoy that movie | Recommender: Primal Fear  (1996) is about a young boy (Norton) who is accused of murder and Gere is defending him in court.
