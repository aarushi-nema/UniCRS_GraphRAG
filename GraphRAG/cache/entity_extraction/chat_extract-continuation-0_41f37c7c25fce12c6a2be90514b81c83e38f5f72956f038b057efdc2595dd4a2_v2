Does genre or time period matter? | User: Not at all. | Recommender: Okay well I'll start with the obvious. What about The Notebook (2004) ? Can't go wrong there. | User: I've seen it. My wife loves it! | Recommender: Okay, what about Collateral Beauty (2016)  with Will Smith? | User: No I haven't seen that. Isn't it about death? | Recommender: Sort of. It's about life in general and overcoming the hardships that go along with it. | Recommender: I would also recommend Reign Over Me (2007) with Don Cheadle and Adam Sandler. | User: What's that about? | Recommender: About a guy (Sandler) who loses his famly on 9/11 and goes into a deep depression/withdrawal. The movie is about how he tries to cope with the loss afterward. | User: Sounds sad. | User: lol | Recommender: I is, but you'll love it. | Recommender: Another good one is Seven Pounds (2008) also starring Will Smith. It's about attonment and forgiveness. | User: I see. These sound like good choices. I'll check them out, thanks! | Recommender: Welcome!\nUser: Hi friend! Can you recommend some goo sci-fi films? | Recommender: Let's see. What sub-genre? Fantasy or more space exploration? Creature feature? | User: Anything you think might have good philosophical or psychological assumptions weaved in. | Recommender: Hmmm.....I would have to suggest Cloverfield (2008) . Not too heave on the philosophy, but it does make you wonder about the backstory of it all. | User: Is that the one by JJ Abrams? | Recommender: Yes. | User: I've heard about that. Heard it was terrible. | Recommender: no, it's pretty good if you take it for what it is and don't compare it to other films. | Recommender: There's also 2 sequesl 10 Cloverfield Lane (2016) and The Cloverfield Paradox (2018) . | Recommender: The latter is only on Netflix for now. | Recommender: Also, similar to those is Life  (2017) . Honestly, if it weren't for the difference in the monster's appearance, you could say Life  (2017)  takes place in the cloververse. | User: Interesting. I've never seen any of these. Will make for an interesting evening. Thanks! :D | Recommender: Welcome!\nRecommender: Hi there! | User: Good afternoon! | User: I'm looking for a good comedy, any ideas? | User: I really like Bridesmaids  (2011) and Wedding Crashers (2005) | Recommender: I see. | Recommender: Is something like Bad Moms (2016) not your taste? | User: Oh yeah, I saw that.  It was pretty good | Recommender: Okay then. What about Talladega Nights: The Ballad of Ricky Bobby (2006) ? I love it, but some of my friends don't care for it. | User: Oh of course, thats a classic! | Recommender: I'll watch anything with Will Ferrell. Speaking of, have you seen The House  (2017) ? | User: Wow, who doesn't like Rickie Bobbie? | User: I have not! | Recommender: Believe, I know a few who say they couldn't stand the movie. | User: Ok!  I think we're all set!  Thanks for your time and take care! | Recommender: You too!\nUser: Hi there! | User: I'm in the mood for a good 80s comedic horror. | Recommender: Hmm..weird request but I think I have an idea. | Recommender: There's Gremlins (1984) and Gremlins 2: The New Batch (1990)  to start | Recommender: The first is more horror and the second more comedy, but both are enjoyable. | User: I've seen those. I like to dark tone of the first better. The second was too silly for me. | Recommender: I happen to agree with you there. | Recommender: Then what about Critters  (1986) ? | User: I've not seen that. | Recommender: WHAT!?!? With the little furballs that eat people!? | User: Flesh-eating hairballs? Pass, lol | Recommender: No they aren't hairballs per se, but these furry &quot;critters&quot; that are highly aggressive and\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>BIRDEMIC: SHOCK AND TERROR (2008)<|>MOVIE<|>A 2008 horror movie known for its poor quality and unintentional humor)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SHARKNADO<|>MOVIE<|>A movie known for its absurd premise of tornadoes filled with sharks)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>THAT'S MY BOY (2012)<|>MOVIE<|>A 2012 comedy movie known for its poor reception and humor)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>BUCKY LARSON: BORN TO BE A STAR (2011)<|>MOVIE<|>A 2011 comedy movie known for its comedic take on the adult film industry)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ADAM SANDLER<|>ACTOR<|>Actor known for his comedic roles in movies)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>NICK SWARDSON<|>ACTOR<|>Actor known for his comedic performances)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>COLLATERAL BEAUTY (2016)<|>MOVIE<|>A 2016 drama movie starring Will Smith)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>REIGN OVER ME (2007)<|>MOVIE<|>A 2007 drama movie starring Don Cheadle and Adam Sandler)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SEVEN POUNDS (2008)<|>MOVIE<|>A 2008 drama movie starring Will Smith)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CLOVERFIELD (2008)<|>MOVIE<|>A 2008 science fiction movie produced by J.J.
