I like Jennifer Aniston better in that role than in movies like The Break-Up (2006) | Recommender: Yes! | User: I liked Role Models (2008) have you ever seen it? | Recommender: No. Havent hear dof it | Recommender: wow.  Havent heard of it\nUser: Hi, i am looking for a good horror movie to watch tonight. | Recommender: Hello. Horror is a good genre, do you think you'd want something classic or more recent? | User: I would prefer more recent. | Recommender: Excellent. One of the better recent horror movies is Nobody Gets Out Alive (2012) | User: Never heard of that one.  What is it about?  I just watched the new It  (2017) movie and didn't find it scary.  Is it anything like It  (2017) ? | Recommender: It's a revenge horror movie where a father avenges the death of his son by hunting the people who killed him. | Recommender: I also saw It  (2017) and didn't find it scary. It was still a good movie though. | Recommender: Another movie you could try is The Conjuring (2013) it's pretty recent and I enjoyed it. Good reviews too. | User: I will have to check out Nobody Gets Out Alive (2012) .  What is the scariest movie you have seen?  The scariest movie  I have ever seen is The Strangers  (2008) | User: Yes I enjoyed The Conjuring (2013) also. | Recommender: The scariest movie I have ever seen probably isn't very scary but has to do with how old I was when I saw it. I'd say it was The Texas Chainsaw Massacre 2 (1986) . I was young when I saw it so it was quite a fright. | Recommender: I have never seen The Strangers  (2008) but I might look into it, thanks! | User: My sister and her boyfriend took me to see Child's Play  (1988) when I was 8.  Scary for my age, but watch it now and it's not so scary.  So I know what you mean. | User: Thanks for the recommendation of Nobody Gets Out Alive (2012) I am going to go check it out  Have a great day. | Recommender: Yes, Chucky was scary as kid for me too! | Recommender: You too!\nUser: Hi! | Recommender: Hello | Recommender: Have you ever watched The Sixth (1981) | User: No I haven't, what's that about? | Recommender: I was wondering myself. My best friend recommended it. | Recommender: I thought he was talking about The Sixth Sense (1999) | Recommender: Are you still there? | User: Yes | User: I'm not really interested in thrillers | User: Maybe something lighter, like a comedy | Recommender: What about comedy? I liked Life  (2007) | Recommender: Eddie Murphy and martin Lawrence was in this one. I thought it was pretty good. | User: Hmm, that sounds pretty interesting | User: Any other movies along those lines | Recommender: I am thinking the year may be wrong. I think it was made in 1999. | Recommender: I actually liked Groundhog Day  (1993) too. | Recommender: Have you ever seen that one? | User: I haven't, actually | User: I know it's a classic | User: I'll give Groundhog Day  (1993) a try, thank you!\nUser: Hello | Recommender: Hi.

Could you maybe tell me a couple that you have seen that you enjoyed? | Recommender: Hi, are you still here? | User: Yes, sorry, my computer froze | Recommender: I understand that!!  Computers, gotta love 'em right? | Recommender: So, can you give me a couple movies you love so I can begin helping you? | User: I really liked Daddy's Home  (2015) and Daddy's Home 2 (2017) | Recommender: Oh yeah.  Good one.  Will Ferrell is one of my favorite actors. | Recommender: How about Step Brothers  (2008) or Stepmom  (1998) Stepmom is a bit older but it's really good. | User: I liked Step Brothers, I haven't seen it in a while. Maybe I'll watch that | Recommender: Okay great!  If that's all I'll watch All About Anna (2005) myself.  Talk to you later.  Goodbye | User: Thank you!\nRecommender: Hey there!
