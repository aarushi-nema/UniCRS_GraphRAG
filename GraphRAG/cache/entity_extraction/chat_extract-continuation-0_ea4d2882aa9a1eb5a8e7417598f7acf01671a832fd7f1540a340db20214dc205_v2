Just some good old blockbuster fun. | Recommender: Okay, what about Jurassic World (2015) | User: I caught that, and that's definitely the kind of movie I have in mind. | Recommender: An older one but still a good one is Independence Day  (1996) | User: I haven't seen that yet, but I remember hearing that it was a winner.
