So futuristic action movies. Will Smith was in iRobot - that's closer | Recommender: I mean, I, Robot  (2004) | User: Sound like something I would watch. | Recommender: Or The Matrix (1999) ? | User: I have also seen Cyborg X. | User: No but have heard great things about it. | Recommender: I haven't seen it either. But you've seen Terminator Genisys (2015) ? | User: Yes. It was awesome. Arnold Schwarzenegger and Matt Smith were great. | Recommender: That's great! | User: I have also seen Survivor (2014) | User: Thanks for the suggestions. | Recommender: Thanks for the chat! | Recommender: Goodbye | User: You too. goodbye\nRecommender: Hello | User: Hey there. | Recommender: Can i get two movie suggestions ? | User: Sure. How about The Shawshank Redemption (1994)? | User: Also, a much more disturbing but cool movie is Natural Born Killers (1994) if you don't mind the blood and violence. | Recommender: I haven't seen any of those | Recommender: how about some classical | Recommender: have you seen Titanic  (1997) ? | User: Yes I have. That was a very good movie. | Recommender: or Deep Blue Sea  (1999) ? | User: I did not see that one before. | Recommender: you should check it out | Recommender: i like horror and action | Recommender: well thank you | User: I'll put that on my watch list. | Recommender: have a good one | User: Good Bye.\nRecommender: hello! | User: Hi | Recommender: What kind of movies do you like or are you looking for? | User: I am looking for a movie that is fun to watch and not too gruesome. | User: My favorite movie of all time might be Goodfellas (1990). | Recommender: Ok, can work with that.  How about Airplane! (1980) or Office Space (1999) but are good comedies,  lol, I'd count Goodfellas (1990) as gruesome | Recommender: both | User: I think I'd want to see Airplane! (1980), and I saw part of Office Space (1999) before and liked it a lot. | User: Another movie I really like is Ghost  (1990). | User: I miss Patrick Swayze. | Recommender: Airplane! (1980) is great, it started a whole new comedy genre. | Recommender: hmm, remember Ghost  (1990)  but don't think I saw it.  Ghostbusters (1984) and Ghostbusters II (1989) are funny if you like ghost movies.  Or Next of Kin  (1984) is my favorite Patrick Swayze movie. | User: That's a pretty good list. | User: Well, see you later. | Recommender: have a great night!\nUser: Hello | Recommender: Hello | Recommender: What movie genre do you like ? | User: I'm hoping for some cool animated movie recommendations. | Recommender: You should check out | Recommender: Or have you seen | Recommender: The Lion King (1994) , Toy Story (1995) , Mulan (1998) Frozen (2013) | Recommender: have you seen theM | User: I really like the The Lion King (1994) , Toy Story (1995), and Mulan (1998), but I wasn't a huge fan of Frozen (2013) | User: I also loved Big Hero 6  (2014) | Recommender: I loved that one two the kid and his brother | Recommender: ok thank you for your suggestion | User: Yeah - It makes me cry every time. | Recommender: have a nice one | User: Thank you, you too!\nUser: hi | Recommender: Hello! | Recommender: What can I do for you today? | User: I like irreverent comedies like Up in Smoke (1978) or Harold & Kumar Go to White Castle (2004) | Recommender: Comedies are great! | Recommender: Do you like romantic comedies? | User: depends, most of the time no.... | Recommender: What does it depend on? | User: who's in it and how sappy it gets | User: would The Hangover (2009)  count as a romcom? | Recommender: I watched one recently. In my opinion it wasn't to sappy. It was sad a little but in a more realistic way. | User: it involved a marriage | Recommender: I'm not sure. I would have to look it up. | User: I was upset when Allen Arkin died in Little Miss Sunshine (2006) | User: what did you see recently? | Recommender: That did stink. | Recommender: It was called Not Another Happy Ending (2013). It's a Scottish comedy which is a turnoff for some people but it's one of my favorites. | User: Can you understand it w/out subs? | User: Love up films usually. | User: UK | Recommender: Yeah. I had no problem understanding it.
