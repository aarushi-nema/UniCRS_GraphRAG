That sounds interesting and I love Jason Statham. | Recommender: If you want a sort of futuristic action movie The One  (2001) is really good. | Recommender: War  (2007) is a crime thriller, it has FBI, tracking Assasins, and asian mobsters. | User: Futuristic movies do sound interesting too I saw one George Clooney Tomorrowland  (2015) and loved that movie. | Recommender: I think you will really love The One  (2001) or even Edge of Tomorrow (2014) | Recommender: Some of the coolest futuristic action movies I have seen.
