I saw it on a wim one day and actually really liked it | User: I have seen Lucy  (2014) kept cringing when I heard that whole &quot;We only use 10 percent of our brains&quot; craps... can Hollywood please quit repeating that BS!  Still, the action was pretty neat | User: Okay, I'll check it out!  Thanks for teh suggestions! | Recommender: excactly | Recommender: have a great day | User: You too\nRecommender: Hello, I would love to recommend some good movies for you today. | Recommender: Did you have anything special in mind? | User: Hi! I'm looking for dog movies. Anything from Cujo  (1983) to Marley & Me  (2008). | Recommender: I loved Cujo  (1983). | Recommender: I have not seen Marley & Me  (2008).  Maybe I would give it a try. | Recommender: Let me brainstorm a bit. | User: It's a real tear-jerker, especially if you have dogs. | Recommender: What about A Dog's Purpose  (2017) | Recommender: Sadly I never had dogs because I grew up in an apartment. | User: Is that the controversial one? Where there was video proof of them throwing a dog into water on scene? | Recommender: I haven't seen it myself, but my friend loves it. She says it focuses on what goes into the mind of a dog. How they can be human like. | Recommender: There's no violence, it's more heart warming in nature. | Recommender: If you like something funnier, what about Air Bud: World Pup (2000) | User: I meant in the filming of the movie. Someone leaked footage of them throwing a dog into water and it being terrified! It was sad and caused a big stir. A lot of people boycotted the movie. | Recommender: It's great, especially if you like soccer. | User: My daughter would love Air Bud. Great suggestion. | Recommender: Oh, that really sad, I was not aware of that. | Recommender: I seen that. It's fun. | User: I appreciate your help! | Recommender: Would you like another recommendation? | User: Off to watch Air Bud! | User: Nope, you've helped enough! | Recommender: Glad to be of service.
