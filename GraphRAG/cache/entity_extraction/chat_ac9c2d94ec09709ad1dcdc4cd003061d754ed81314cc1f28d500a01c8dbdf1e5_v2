Goodbye!\nRecommender: Good evening! | User: hey there | User: do you know any good romantic comedies | Recommender: I've got a few in mind. | User: yay | Recommender: If you like Joss Whedon and Shakespeare, check out Much Ado About Nothing  (2016) .  It's a modern retelling of the play (maintaining Elizabethan language) starring a lot of Mr. Whedon veterans. | Recommender: Mr. Whedon's* | Recommender: Sorry, my spelling is off tonight. | User: that sounds really good! | Recommender: I also enjoy Kevin Smith and the one film that truly brought him to prominence was Chasing Amy (1997) .  It diverts from the traditional ending, but it still has a great message. | Recommender: It's not my favorite by him, but it's one of his best from a technical and artist perspective. | User: i remember that one i must add it to my list and watch it again | User: one of my favorite romantic classics is Dirty Dancing | Recommender: Now I have the music stuck in my head... | Recommender: It's all good though. | User: haha | Recommender: I've got a quirky romantic comedy if you're interested.  All's Faire in Love (2009) .  The jokes can get raunchy, but it's a cool like flick where Christina Ricci stretches her acting chops in a Renaissance faire. | User: oo that sounds like it would be a good one. i def have to check it out! | User: thanks for the suggestions! | Recommender: No problem.  Now to try and get some catchy songs out of my head.  :) | Recommender: Have a good night!\nUser: hey | Recommender: Good evening! | User: do you know any good romantic comedies? | Recommender: My girlfriend recently got me into John Hughs films.  Sixteen Candles (1984) was surprising good. | User: that sounds great | User: i loved the 80s movies | User: my fav was Dirty Dancing | Recommender: She also showed me A Midsummer Night's Dream  (1999)  with Stanley Tucci as Puck.  I admit  haven't seen too many adaptations of it, but I still really enjoyed it (the other ones were kind of bad though). | User: thats a good one. i gotta add that to my list | User: i heard Friends with Benefits  (2011) was funny. i gotta check that out | Recommender: If you're into indie, I'd also recommend My Life in Ruins (2009) .  It's a pretty &quot;by-the-books&quot; rom-com (woman is in a rut and embraces her inner fun to find love and happiness), but it's still a decently solid film by Nia Vardolous (writer and star of My Big Fat Greek Wedding). | Recommender: I haven't seen Friends with Benefits  (2011) , but I've heard good things about it. | User: i loved My Big Fat Greek Wedding (2002)  so that one is prob worth checking out | User: thanks for the great suggestions! | Recommender: No problem!  Have a great night and happy watching!\nUser: Hi! | User: I am looking for a comedy | User: I really like adam sandler | Recommender: love comedy | User: i loved Big Daddy  (1999) | User: Not really a fan of his new stuff | Recommender: Ok so a few great films see with him would be Happy Gilmore (1996) | User: oh man i loved that too | Recommender: yeah his newer stuff isn't that great | Recommender: Just go to your home. I love it haha | Recommender: Another great film was The Waterboy (1998) | User: oh yeah. Great one | User: Spanglish  (2004) was a curveball for him. I liked it, but it was hard to have him be serious | Recommender: Big Daddy  (1999)  is surely his best film in my opinion | Recommender: I havent seen that one actually but heard good things. | User: well thank you for your recommendations! | User: I hope you have a good day | Recommender: Have you seen that film The Wedding Singer (1998) | User: oh yeah | User: gerat one | Recommender: Its with Drew Barymore and great old time feels | Recommender: Hmmmm You're a tough one haha have you seen 50 First Dates (2004) | Recommender: Its a great one also with Drew Barrymore | User: I have, but its ok, you gave some good ones.thank you for your help! | Recommender: no problem | Recommender: Have a wonderful day!\nUser: hi there | Recommender: Hey there! | User: Could you suggest a good drama for me? | Recommender: Would you like to hear about some really good films today? | Recommender: Sure thing! How about we start off with Jumanji  (2017) | User: I've yet to see that one but I'm dying to! | Recommender: Its still in theaters but if you know of any other way you can enjoy it | Recommender: No way you should totally watch it! | User: I'm going to check it out now, lol | User: Do you have any recommendations for fantasy movies? | User: Like Harry Potter  | Recommender: Another pretty good movie thats fantasy would be Thor: Ragnarok (2017\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}], "parameters": {"model": "gpt-3.5-turbo", "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "temperature": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0}}}
