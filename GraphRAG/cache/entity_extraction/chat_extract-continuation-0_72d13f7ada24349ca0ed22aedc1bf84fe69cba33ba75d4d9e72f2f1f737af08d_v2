How are you? | User: Hi, how are you? Can you recommend any horror cult classics? | Recommender: Sure, I love horror films.  I think one that is often overlooked is Phantasm  (1979) .  Some of the dialogue is stiff, but it has a unique concept and great scares. | User: Oh that sounds really good! I like good scares!

It's a collection of stories so I'm sure there would be something in there you would enjoy. | User: No I don't like playful. Looking for something intense! | Recommender: Thank you!  It sounds like you have good taste, too.  Finally, I would suggest The Exorcist  (1973) .  Always my go-to when I want to be truly frightened.
