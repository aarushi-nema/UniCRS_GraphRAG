Have you seen Clueless  (1995) or The Lucky One  (2012)? | User: No I haven't but they both sound really good.  I'll check them both out. | Recommender: And if you like Anne Hathaway, I have to suggest The Devil Wears Prada  (2006). | User: Oh I've seen The Devil Wears Prada, that was really good.  Another one of my favorites.  Thank you. | User: I have to go.  It was nice chatting and I'll def check out those recommendations.  Goodbye! | Recommender: Okay, bye!\nUser: Hello. | Recommender: Hi.  How are you? | User: I'm doing okay. | User: And you? | Recommender: Great.  I was just going through movies with a friend.  You wouldn't believe how many movies are out there! | User: I know there are a lot! | User: I'm looking for a good romance.  If it has any sci-fi or fantasy elements, that's even better.  One that I really liked is About Time  (2013). | Recommender: Okay, I can sure recommend a couple for you. | User: And another one I can think of is The Secret Life of Walter Mitty  (2013). | User: Thanks, I'd appreciate it. | Recommender: I really liked The Secret Life of Walter Mitty.  Have you had a chance to see Love Actually (2003) It doesn't have the sci fi to it but it is good. | User: Yes, I have seen that one.  I agree that it's good! | Recommender: A sci fi one with a bit of romance I would recommend would be the new Star Trek Beyond (2016) They are doing an awesome job with these new ones. | User: Great, I haven't seen that one!  I have seen the older Star Trek  (2009) movies.  Up through 4, I think.  So I might like Star Trek Beyond (2016). | Recommender: Okay great.  I'm glad I was able to help.  I'm gonna finish up with my friend so I'll TTYL. Goodbye. | User: Bye!\nUser: Hello. | Recommender: Hi there. | Recommender: Are you looking for a movie in a particular genre? | User: How is your night going so far? I just watched The Ring  (2017)  and now I would like to find some more good horror movies. | User: If you aren't a fan of that genre though some good drama movies would be fine too. | Recommender: My night is going pretty well.  Hang on a second, and I can suggest some movies for you. | User: Ok. Cool. Thank you. | Recommender: Have you seen Get Out (2017) or Happy Death Day  (2017)?  Both newer movies. | User: I have not seen either of those although I have heard of the first one. I will check them out. | Recommender: And there is also the remake of It  (2017), which is good. | User: I can't believe I forgot about that movie. I've been looking forward to it coming out on DVD. | User: Thank you for the suggestions. I will definitely be watching It  (2017) | Recommender: You're welcome. | Recommender: Have a great night! | User: you too!\nUser: Hi there | Recommender: Hi!  How is your evening going? | User: It's going great.  I'm a bit bored and looking for a movie though. | Recommender: What kind of movie are you in the mood for? | User: I don't want anything action packed tonight.  I kinda want something boring, lol, something to help relax me and get me ready for sleep | Recommender: A boring movie, huh?  LOL.  Can you give me an example or two of the kind you're looking for? | User: I think something like Cinderella  (2015) or The Princess Diaries  (2001) would be just the thing | Recommender: Well, if you like princess movies, there is Ella Enchanted  (2004). | User: Oh that does sound good.  Can you give me one more just in ? | Recommender: Or Enchanted  (2007), too.  Great Disney movie. | Recommender: Or The Prince and Me (2004).  That one is always fun. | User: Those sound awesome.  I'm gonna let you go and see if I can find those.  Thanks for the help. Goodbye | Recommender: Okay, bye!\nUser: Hello. | Recommender: Hi, how's it going? | User: Good. Yourself? | Recommender: Also good. | User: I was hoping to get some recommendations on some newer movies. | Recommender: Okay, give me just a second. | User: It doesn't have to be this year, perhaps 2-3 years old as well. | User: Ok. | Recommender: Do you like animated movies?  Coco  (2017) is a newer movie and really cute. | User: Sure. Some animated films are great. I loved Finding Nemo (2003) | User: I haven't seen your suggestion but I'll look into it. | Recommender: Or there is Jumanji  (2017).  It would be as good as the original, except it doesn't have Robin Williams. :( | User\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}], "parameters": {"model": "gpt-3.5-turbo", "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "temperature": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0}}}
