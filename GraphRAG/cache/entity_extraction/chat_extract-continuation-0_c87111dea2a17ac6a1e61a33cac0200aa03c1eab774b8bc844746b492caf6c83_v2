It was really good | Recommender: And while I'm thinking about it, Split (2017) with James McAvoy is an intense film. Not as intense as say, Seven  (1995) , but it's still good. | User: The Life of David Gale (2003) is another murder mystery movie that I love because it's sort of similar to Seven  (1995) which I love. | User: I have seen Split (2017) which was good. | Recommender: I've never seen The Life of David Gale (2003) . Who's in it? | User: Kevin Spacey is starring in it with Kate Winslet, it is about a man who is accused of murder, but he was an activist against the death penalty, but it's ironic because now he is on death row for a murder he claims he did not commit. | Recommender: Oh okay. Sounds almost like Just Cause  (1995) with Sean Connery. | User: Never seen that one, but I will check that one out! | User: Thank you for the suggestions! | User: Have a nice day. | Recommender: You're welcome. Enjoy!\nUser: Hi! Can you recommend some good dark Christmas movies? | Recommender: Dark Christmas? I'll give it a shot. | Recommender: Okay I've got a few! | Recommender: First up is A Christmas Horror Story (2015) | Recommender: This one is a collection of short films with dark Christmas themes. Krampus being one of them | Recommender: There's also Krampus  (2015) itself. It's good. My kids liked it. But it's just on the edge of scary/creepy. It doesn't do much to terrify you though | User: Is that the one with Stefania Owen? | User: And Toni Collette? | Recommender: It is. Have you seen it? | User: No but I've seen the first few minutes of it on HBO. Looked good but I fell asleep, lol | Recommender: There's also Santa's Slay (2005) . It's a cheesy slasher flick with Santa as the killer. | User: oh god! lol | Recommender: My thoughts exactly | Recommender: Last there's Silent Night, Deadly Night (1984) about a kid who goes on a homicidal rage dressed as Santa. Pretty decent | User: I think I've seen that one. But I'll cehck it out again to be sure. | User: Thanks for the suggestions friend! | Recommender: no probl. night!\nUser: hello!! | User: how are u | User: I like comedy movies | Recommender: I am good thank you.
