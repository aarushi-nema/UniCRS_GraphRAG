Any idea when it was released? | Recommender: I believe it was release a couple of years ago?  What about Thor: Ragnarok (2017) the follow up.  It was last year. | User: I haven't seen that either, but I'll have to look for it! | Recommender: What genre do you like? | User: Any others that you can suggest?  I like comedies like Groundhog Day  (1993), romantic movies like Notting Hill , and dramas like Good Will Hunting (1997).  Also sci-fi like The Matrix (1999). | Recommender: That's quite a wide variety.  I though The Matrix (1999) was too weird, especially the sequels. | User: Yeah, the sequels weren't as good as the original. | Recommender: Thanks for the reminder about Groundhog Day  (1993) I think I'll watch it this weekend. | User: Thanks for chatting, and have a good night!\nUser: Hi, I'd like to see a movie | Recommender: Hello what scary movies you like | User: I liked Scary Movie (2000) | User: And Scream  (1996) | Recommender: those are good ones! have you seen It  (2017) | Recommender: or the older one | User: No, I have not seen It  (2017) | User: I read the book though | User: good book | User: long | User: What about The Shining  (1980) ? | User: That was a good one | Recommender: i will have to check it out. i really wanna see the movie coming out called Forever My Girl  (2018) | User: I'll have to check out It  (2017) | Recommender: that was a pretty good movie | User: Okay, have a good day | Recommender: you to thank you\nUser: Hello | Recommender: Hi, what kind of movies are you looking for? | User: I like somewhat realistic science fiction. | Recommender: Okay.  How about The Matrix (1999) or Passengers  (2016)?  Have you seen those? | User: I have seen The Matrix (1999) I have not seen Passengers  (2016). Is it somewhat intellectual like Arrival  (2016)? | Recommender: I guess you could say that, yes.  There is an ethical dilemma that the main character has to work through, which makes it interesting to me. | User: Oh cool. | Recommender: I also liked The Martian  (2015). | User: I haven't seen that either! Which would you say is more like Arrival  (2016)? | Recommender: Probably Passengers  (2016). | User: Oh, that's interesting. I had sort of discounted it as just mostly fluff sci-fi, but I do like the actors in it. | Recommender: I also recommend Serenity  (2005), but it probaby works better if you have seen the series that preceded it. | User: Right, I have heard of it, but not seen it. I think I will go with Passengers  (2016) I should not have discounted it without viewing it. | User: Thanks for your suggestions, it was super helpful! | Recommender: No problem.  Have a nice evening! | User: You too, good bye!\nRecommender: Hi | User: Hey!
