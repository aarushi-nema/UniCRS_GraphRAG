What is your favorite genre? | User: I like military movies like Saving Private Ryan (1998) | Recommender: That's a good one! Have you seen Full Metal Jacket (1987) ? | User: I haven't! I will have to look for that one | User: I have American Sniper (2014) on my to watch list too | Recommender: That sounds good! I enjoyed 300  (2007) though it is a bit different than other war movies | User: I liked that one too! | User: I like action movies, not just the military ones | Recommender: Same! Ocean's 11 (1960) is a classic for me | User: I don't think I've seen that one but saw a more recent one Ocean's Thirteen (2007) | Recommender: That's a good one! I'm glad we had this talk | User: Ditto!\nRecommender: Hello, how are you. | User: good you | Recommender: I’m good too. Just browsing Netflix | User: have you seen Bright (2017) | Recommender: I haven’t, is it good. | User: its good avoid the reveiws tho | Recommender: I was trying to see if Netflix has Bad Moms (2016).

It  (2017) was a really good one. Maybe something like that? | Recommender: Well yes but I also recommend you first watch It  (1966) before you watch It  (2017) , so that way you can make a comparison. | User: That sounds like a good idea. What about The Shining  (1980) ? | Recommender: Also have you seen Annabelle  (2014) , it is definitely worth it, since its based on a true story. | User: I think I will try that one.
