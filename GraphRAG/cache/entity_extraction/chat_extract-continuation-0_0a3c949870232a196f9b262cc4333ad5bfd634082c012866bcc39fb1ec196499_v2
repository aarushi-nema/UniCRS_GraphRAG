What type of movie are you interested in? | User: I like comedies. | Recommender: Have you seen Little Nicky (2000) ? | User: Yes | Recommender: I really enjoyed Thor: Ragnarok (2017) it has quite a bit of humor in it. | User: I haven't seen that one.  I'm not big into the comic book movies, but maybe I'll check it out. | User: What's your favorite movie? | Recommender: My favorite of all time is The Notebook (2013) | User: That's a good one. I like it. | User: I have a few favorites.  One of them is Forrest Gump (1994) | Recommender: Another great movie is Bedtime Stories  (2008) | User: That is a good one. | Recommender: Forrest Gump (1994) is a fantastic movie. Did you see Patch Adams  (1998) ? | User: I think I saw it.  It's been a while. | Recommender: It's not exactly a complete comedy, but I enjoyed it. | User: Still good. | User: What kind of movies do you like? | Recommender: I enjoy romantic comedies or christian movies. Have you seen God's Not Dead  (2014) ? | User: Oh yes. | User: I thought it was good.  It wasn't great, but good enough. | Recommender: I'm really looking forward to seeing A Wrinkle in Time  | User: I don't know.  I liked the book and I'd like to see it adapted into a movie, but I'm not sure about this one. | Recommender: I hope it's good. Most of the time movies made from books aren't the greatest. Did you see Ender's Game  (2013) ? | User: No, I haven't.  Have you? | Recommender: I did. It wasn't good, it was loosely based on the book at best. | User: Yeah, that happens a lot. | Recommender: It does. A movie I always watch when I can't find something else is Stardust  (2007) it is a fantastic silly movie. | User: It's okay. | User: The last movie I watched was National Velvet  on TV the other night.  What about you? | Recommender: I saw the new Jumanji  (2017) a few weeks ago. It was pretty good. Today my children's made me sit through Moana  (2016) | User: Did you not like it? | User: I haven't seen Moana yet. | Recommender: I liked Jumanji  (2017)  for what it was. Moana  (2016) is great it is far better than the other recent Disney movies, however 100 plus times on a movie is my limit. | User: I understand that! | Recommender: I suppose there are far worse things to complain of. Have you seen Lady in the Water (2006)? It was one of my favorite movies a couple years ago. | User: I can't recall that I have. | User: Maybe I should watch it. | Recommender: It's by M. Night Shamalan, and not super suspenseful, but I loved the story. | Recommender: I think I remember hearing that it is based on a bed time story he told his kids. | User: Interesting. | Recommender:
