Sounds interesting. | User: Yes! I love that one! | Recommender: I feel like High Noon (1952) is a movie everyone should see at least once. | Recommender: I also really like Dances with Wolves (1990) | User: I agree. Even my grandpa in Japan loved that movie. | User: Yes! Kevin Costner in that movie is pretty good. | Recommender: Thats awesome! | User: Well, thank you for the suggestions and reminding me of those other great movies. Have a good night. | Recommender: Good night!\nRecommender: Good evening! | User: Hello! Can you help me find some movies with dogs in them? | Recommender: Yes! I have always loved dog movies. | Recommender: Have you seen Hachi: A Dog's Tale (2009) with Richard Gere? | User: I haven't. Is it sad or happy? | Recommender: Well, kind of both. Kind of sad. It is about a dog who waits at the same train station for his owner everyday, but the owner gets sick. | Recommender: Sorry, kind of a spoiler... but it is a sweet story. It based on a true story. | Recommender: There is a train station in Japan and they have a statue of this dog. | User: That sounds really interesting actually. | Recommender: It's beautiful. It's kind of a popular meeting place. | User: Do you know any more dog movies like that? | Recommender: Another dog movie that I really loved when I was younger is Homeward Bound: The Incredible Journey (1993). | Recommender: Have you seen that one? | User: I have seen that one, It's really nostalgic for me. | Recommender: Me too. I don't usually love when animals talk, but I really liked this one. | Recommender: What is your favorite dog movie? | User: Maybe not a true dog movie but i'm fond of Toto from The Wizard of Oz  (1939) | Recommender: Oh gosh. He is cute. | Recommender: I also liked Eight Below (2006). It has huskies in it and I grew up with huskies. | Recommender: They are beautiful dogs and the story was pretty good and exciting. | User: I haven't seen that. I love huskies, so that seems like a good choice. | Recommender: It was good. I just watched it with my kids and they loved it. Now they want a dog, but my son is sadly very allergic. | Recommender: I hope you get a chance to watch those! | User: I'm putting them on my list, thank you very much. | User: Have a good night! | Recommender: You are welcome. | Recommender: Bye!\nUser: Hello! | Recommender: Hello, what kind of movies are you interested in? | User: I like dramas and action movies. | Recommender: Have you seen Dunkirk  (2017)? I really enjoyed that one. | User: I did. It was really good. Kind of stressful to watch, but I enjoyed it. | Recommender: What about the new Tomb Raider (2018) movie? much less stressful. | User: No! I didn't even realize they had remade it. Is it good? | Recommender: It's really good. Still in theaters too. | User: I'll have to watch it. | Recommender: I also really enjoyed Black Panther (2018) as well. | User: I need to see that one too. I just watched Doctor Strange  (2016). The newer Marvel movies are pretty good. | User: I heard that Black Panther (2018) was a little darker, did you think so? | Recommender: I feel like they are getting better and better. Also if you like funny action Deadpool  (2016) was great | Recommender: Yes | User: Saw that one and can't wait for the next! | User: Thank you for the suggestions. I need to go and see those. | Recommender: The next one will be sure to be amazing. | Recommender: Hope I helped you out. | User: You did! Thank you. Have a good night! | Recommender: Bye!\nRecommender: Good evening! | User: Hello! | User: Hello! | Recommender: What kind of movies do you like! | User: I am interested in some funny or action movies. | User: Such as Deadpool  (2016) or Shaun of the Dead (2004) ! | Recommender: Those are great ones! Have you seen Zombieland (2009)? | User: I have not! What is it about&gt; | Recommender: It's kind of a classic zombie movie. People are turning into zombies and there are four survivors. They all kind of have funny quirks. | Recommender: There are some funny cameos in it too | User: Oh sweet, sounds right up my alley. I will for sure check it out! | User: While on the subject, any other zombie movies? I do love those. | Recommender: I really liked Warm Bodies  (2013). It was pretty funny. | Recommender: Then again, I watched it pretty late at night and things seem to be funnier then. | Recommender: Have you seen that one? | User: No I haven't. If it is zombies I will probably like it either way. I'll give it a try! | User: Thanks for the suggestions! | Recommender: You are welcome.
