It's about an evil entity that devours the inhabitants of earth after an asteroid crashes the planet. | Recommender: It's animated thought. | User: Oh, I'm not into anime. | Recommender: Oh okay. Well what about something like Willow  (1988) | Recommender: It's not urban fantasy but good | Recommender: It's like LOTR but with more magic. | User: I see. I think I might like that. | User: You know there aren't manyy good epic Fantasy movies out. | User: I mean urban | Recommender: No there aren't. Also, speaking of epic fantasy Warcraft  (2016) is really good. | Recommender: I hope they make more. | User: I heard it was good. I'll check it out today. Thanks for the suggestions. :)\nUser: Hi. Know any good movies? | Recommender: Sure. What are you looking for? | User: Some horror or mystery? | Recommender: Okay. Have you seen Murder on the Orient Express (2017) ? | User: I've seen the older version but not the new one. How is it? | Recommender: If you liked the original, you will love the new one. | User: :) | Recommender: Also, @The Mummy was good | Recommender: It's more action than horror thought | Recommender: Underworld: Blood Wars (2017) is good. a little more fantasy than horror but it has werewolves and vampires | User: I liked the first @Underworld  movie | User: Have not seen the others | Recommender: I didn't too much care for Underworld: Rise of the Lycans (2009) but the rest of the franchise is decent | User: why didn you like that one? | Recommender: Because its a prequel and doesn't deal with the primary timeline from the first film | Recommender: The best of the franchise in my opinion is Underworld: Evolution (2006) it explains more of the backstory of the blood fued between the two races | User: I see. Oh okay. Thanks. Guess it's going to be an Underworldly kind of night. Take care\nUser: Hey!  I am looking for a good movie. | Recommender: Okay. What genre are you a fan of? | User: I like horror movies similar to The Blair Bitch Project (1999) | Recommender: okay. Have you seen Blair Witch  (2016) ? The remake? | Recommender: Or continuation rather | User: I did not.  Is it silly like the sequel Book of Shadows: Blair Witch 2 (2000) ? | Recommender: It's more of a serious tone like the first film | Recommender: Also, have you seen @The Witch (2015) | User: I did.  It was very good!  Much better than The Conjuring (2013) ! | Recommender: WHAAAT!?! You didn't like The Conjuring (2013) I loved it. :) | User: Heh, I guess it wasn't that bad!  Insidious  (2011) was worse!  :P | Recommender: Definitely Agree! | User: I like goofy horror movies when they are meant to be goofy.  Like The Texas Chainsaw Massacre 2 (1986) | User: But bad horror movies are just bad. | Recommender: I agree. You want to be terrified a bit, not looking at the screen thinking WTF??\nUser: Hi can you recommend a good movie | Recommender: Sure. What genre? | User: Horror. Something with witches and demons | Recommender: Oh that's easy. Have you seen Blair Witch  (2016) ? | User: No. But I've seen The Blair Witch Project (1999) are they similar? | Recommender: They are. But the newer film is more of a continuation than a remake. | Recommender: And it's not silly like Book of Shadows: Blair Witch 2 (2000) | User: Oh okay. I was wondering about that. Good to hear that. I hate stupid horror. | User: Like Child's Play 2 (1990) . The first was good, then the rest got all silly and stupid | Recommender: But it's different when it's meant to be funny. Like A Nightmare on Elm Street (1984) | User: True. The humor made sense along with the gore. | User: Thanks for your suggestions. You've been a big help today. :)\nRecommender: Hey!  Have you seen Wonder Woman  (2017) yet?  It is really good. | User: No I have not, who is it starring? | User: I like horror movies. | User: Hello? | Recommender: I like those too! | Recommender: Particularly gory ones like The Texas Chain Saw Massacre (1974) | User: Do you have any suggestions for horror films? | Recommender: Have you seen it? | User: I have never seen the original, only the ones from 2003 and 2006 | User: I like all Amityville horror movies. | Recommender: (And Wonder Woman  (2017) stars Gal Gadot). | User: Okay I will watch it today, my mom's favorite comic character is Wonder Woman. | Recommender: Those are good!
