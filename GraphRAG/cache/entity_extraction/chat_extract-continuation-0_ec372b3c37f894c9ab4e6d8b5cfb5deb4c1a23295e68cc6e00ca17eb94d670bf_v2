What about something similar to that? | Recommender: Id have to say another good one was The Shawshank Redemption (1994) | User: I saw that as well. What did you think of it? | Recommender: I thought it was a good movie. Do you have any other suspense thriller suggestions | User: Sure, I would have to recommend Chinatown  (1974) , there's a good chance you haven't seen it. Casino  (1995) is another hidden gem. | Recommender: I havent seen either of those. I do like mobster movies also is casino like that | User: Oh yea, it's THE mobster movie in my opinion. It's real gritty and the acting is phenomenal. It's an extremely long movie. | Recommender: Awesome i will check it out. Thank you for your suggestions. Have a great night\nRecommender: Hi, how are you? | User: Doing well thanks. Seen anything good lately? | Recommender: Yeah, in fact I loved Mother! (2017). It was a hidden gem that came out last year. | User: Really, hadn't heard of that one. I tend to have fairly wide tastes in movies, so I should check it out. | Recommender: Yeah, it's a horror movie in a David Fincher style, very mixed reviews, but it was great. What's a good movie you'd like a similar recommendation for? | User: Have you heard anything about Bright (2017) ? | Recommender: You know, I haven't. It looked interesting when it popped up on Netflix, a good action movie they put out a little bit like that though is Beasts of No Nation  (2015). Bright (2017)  got some real bad reviews, so I passed. | User: Will Smith does seem rather hit and miss on his movies these days. | Recommender: Yeah the last movie I saw that I liked in him was The Pursuit of Happyness (2006) . | User: I actually liked all three of the Men in Black  (1997) movies | Recommender: Oh yeah, they were good. Well that's enough movies for me tonight, thanks for the conversation! | User: Thanks for the advice, see you around\nRecommender: Hello | User: Hello. What kind of movies do you like? | Recommender: I like romantic comedies mostly but horror is good too. How about you? | User: I like a variety of genres. I am keen to romantic comedies. I do like 50 First Dates (2004) | Recommender: Yes. That is a good one. One of my favs is Hitch  (2005) , | Recommender: I must say that Pretty Woman (1990) is a nice classic. Not super funny but still good. | User: I do like Hitch  (2005) . I am also a fan of When Harry Met Sally... (1989) | Recommender: Yes! that's a great one! | User: Another good one is Pretty Woman (1990) | Recommender: So is Sleepless in Seattle (1993) | User: Oh yeah i love how they end up together in the end | Recommender: Yes they always have the best endings | Recommender: Well nice chatting. You enjoy the rest of your weekend! | User: You too thank you\nRecommender: Hi how are you? | User: I'm great, thank you. What movie shall we discuss? | Recommender: Well I can recommend you some movies, based on a movie you really like. | User: I I like Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri (2017) a lot; I saw it for the second time today. | User: What films have you seen lately that you have enjoyed and would recommend? | Recommender: That's really cool, I would recommend Django Unchained (2012) based on that, have you seen it? I really need to check out that movie though, because I have one of those MoviePasses and am always looking for highly rated movies, missed this one! | Recommender: I personally saw Mother! (2017)  recently and I really recommend it if you like alternative horror films. | User: I hated Mother! (2017) ! I wanted to walk out but my friend forced me to stay based on the tine I forced her to see Little Man  (2006) | Recommender: Oh gosh, you subjected her to torture. The last movie I walked out on was Murder on the Orient Express (2017). | User: It was torture! It was stupid I couldn't leave. Mother! (2017) bothered me on multiple levels. Have you seen Rosemary's Baby  (1968) | Recommender: Yeah I liked that did you? | User: I could watch it over and over. I tend to see a lot of films on planes as I travel overseas every couple of weeks. I have watched Jackie  (2016) multiple times recently. Have you seen it? | Recommender: I haven't. I will check it out though. Well, I'm all movied out and am going to go. It was nice talking to you, have a good rest of your day! | User: Bye!\nUser: Hi, how are you? | Recommender: How are you doing today? | Recommender: Oh, good! | Recommender: What's a great movie you've seen that I can recommend more for? | User: Well, I love the movie Bad Moms (2016). | Recommender:\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>THE MATRIX (1999)<|>MOVIE<|>A 1999 science fiction movie starring Keanu Reeves and directed by the Wachowskis)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>KEANU REEVES<|>ACTOR<|>Lead actor in The Matrix (1999))\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>THE WACHOWSKIS<|>DIRECTOR<|>Directors of The Matrix (1999))\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SCI-FI<|>GENRE<|>The Matrix belongs to the science fiction genre (inferred from general knowledge of the movie))\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>KEANU REEVES<|>THE MATRIX (1999)<|>Keanu Reeves stars in The Matrix)<|>\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>THE WACHOWSKIS<|>THE MATRIX (1999)<|>The Wachowskis directed The Matrix)<|>\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>THE MATRIX (1999)<|>SCI-FI<|>The Matrix belongs to the science fiction genre (inferred))<|>\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>THE SHAWSHANK REDEMPTION (1994)<|>MOVIE<|>A 1994 drama movie considered a classic)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CHINATOWN (1974)<|>MOVIE<|>A 1974 mystery movie)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CASINO (1995)<|>MOVIE<|>A 1995 crime movie)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CRIME<|>GENRE<|>Casino belongs to the crime genre (inferred))\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>CASINO (1995)<|>CRIME<|>Casino belongs to the crime genre (inferred))<|>\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>MOTHER!
