(2017) , but The Shining  (1980) is a great movie. | User: I've seen The Amityville Horror but not The Conjuring.  Is it good? | Recommender: Yes I really like The Conjuring (2013) | Recommender: Also have you seen It  (2017) ? | User: The Mother was pretty good.  Not really horror but very chilling nonetheless. | User: No, I haven't seen IT either.  But I have heard it has some great reviews. | Recommender: Yes, I really liked It  (2017) ! | User: I'll look up IT and The conjuring.  Both seem like movies I'd like to see. | Recommender: Great.  I hope you enjoy them! | Recommender: Have a great day!  Bye. | User: fBye\nRecommender: Hey there! What kind of movies can I help you with today? | User: I'm looking for something funny I can watch with my kids. | Recommender: Ok great I would recommend Groundhog Day  (1993) it's a old movie but so funny and kid friendly. | Recommender: Austin Powers in Goldmember (2002) is another funny one and the kids will enjoy it also. | Recommender: Are you wanting some animated comedy movies also? | User: They tend to like animated, but either would be good. | Recommender: Ok great! Inside Out  (2015) is fairly new and funny and the kids will love the characters. | User: They just watched the The Emoji Movie (2017) and thought it was funny. | Recommender: Coco  (2017) is a newer movie that came out and I watched it last night with my kids and they loved it. | User: Coco  (2017) sounds like a good one, I forgot about that movie. | Recommender: The Emoji Movie (2017) I will have to check out tonight with my kids. I hope I was able to help you find a good movie. Enjoy your movies. | User: Thanks!\nRecommender: Hello. | Recommender: What kind of movie are you looking for today? | User: Hello, how are you? | Recommender: I'm good and you? | User: I would like some action movie suggestions please.

Don't care for super hero movies. Have you seen them? | Recommender: Yes they're both really good. | Recommender: Sorry let me think of something action that's not super hero. | User: I think I will pass on them. | Recommender: How about Divergent  (2014) ? | User: Yes I saw this movie and enjoyed it. | Recommender: Have you seen any of the The Hunger Games  (2012) movies? | User: Not my type of movie; never saw one. | Recommender: Ok.

Have you seen Deadpool  (2016) ? | Recommender: Oh ok Robin Williams no problem.

I'm sorry | Recommender: Hook  (1991) is another classic of his and you can get it on DVD. | User: I seen Flubber too and liked it. | Recommender: Patch Adams  (1998) is more on the emotional side but full of laughs. You can also get on DVD. | User: I haven't seen Hook.  That sounds like a winner in my book.  I'll see if I can find it. | User: Yes, I seen Patch Adams.  I think that was a cry for help on his part. | Recommender: Jack  (1996) is also another Robin Williams\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}], "parameters": {"model": "gpt-3.5-turbo", "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "temperature": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0}}}
