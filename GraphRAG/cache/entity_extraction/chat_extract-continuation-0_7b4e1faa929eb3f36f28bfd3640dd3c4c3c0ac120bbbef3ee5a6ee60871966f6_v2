A film about retired spies on a mission | Recommender: LOL | User: I didn't see the sequel. | Recommender: We are thinking about the same films | User: That's funny. | Recommender: Cool | User: I also remember him in Hudson Hawk (1991) | User: oldie but goodie. | Recommender: There is a different kind of action in futuristic film. If you like futuristic utopian stories then the The Divergent Series are  great | Recommender: Oh Ididn;t see Hudson Hawk (1991)  Hawk o rmaybe I don't remember it. | User: He was a thief I think. | Recommender: Ok | User: Divergent  (2014) was good, the sequels not so much | Recommender: Agreed | User: Well thanks for the suggestions.

Have a great afternoon! | User: Bye\nRecommender: good day | Recommender: how may I help you ? | User: Hi, any romantic comedies you can recommend? | Recommender: comedy is so subjective, do you mind giving me a couple ideas of what you found as a romantic comedy? | User: Sure, something with Resse Witherspoon would work. | Recommender: I have to say, even though much of her earlier work were in the comedy genre, as an adult, she's really moved into a heavy drama genre.  It's good I think! | Recommender: anyways | Recommender: the first suggestion is NOT a Reese film but is funny, and that's When Harry Met Sally... (1989) | User: Sure. She kind of did drama young too with Fear  (1990) | Recommender: she did but then she went into the whole Legally Blonde (2001) series. | User: Not really a heavy drama though. | User: She was good in Election  (2005) n | Recommender: anyway, if you like Reese and haven't seen Legally Blonde (2001) and the sequel it's really light comedic watching. | User: Sure. Thanks | Recommender: A modern Reese comedy I'd say, would be Hot Pursuit  (2015) | User: Great suggestion. | Recommender: Sophia Vigara is in that too | User: Yea, she is funny on TV, so she might be funny in that one. | User: Have a good day! | Recommender: ok, you too!  happy Reese day! | User: You too!\nRecommender: Hi there what kind of movies do you like? | User: I like some action like True Lies (1994) | User: or Ghost Rider  (2007) | Recommender: Have you seen The Running Man  (1987) ? | User: oh yes its an old one as well | Recommender: I think True Lies (1994) Lies is probably my husbands favorite movie of all time.
