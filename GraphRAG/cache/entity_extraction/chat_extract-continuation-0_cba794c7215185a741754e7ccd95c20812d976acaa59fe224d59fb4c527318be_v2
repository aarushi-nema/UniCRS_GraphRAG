THank you for your help | Recommender: no problem | User: Bye\nRecommender: Hey there | User: Hello! How are you today. | Recommender: Not bad. Yourself? :) What type of films do you enjoy? | User: I'm okay. I tend to enjoy either comedies or action/adventure depending on my mood. | Recommender: Hmmm in terms of action I really liked White House Down (2013). | Recommender: I'd also like to suggest something that's a comedy and action. Rush Hour  (1998). It's hilarious and has great action scenes | User: I have not seen White House Down (2013) but I have seen Rush Hour  (1998) and thought that it was hilarious and entertaining. | Recommender: It is! I also really liked Olympus Has Fallen (2013). Cheesy action but really entertaining overall | Recommender: A few last suggestions that have both comedy and a little bit of action are Zombieland (2009) and | User: Cheesy can make for some good entertainment now and then. | Recommender: Shaun of the Dead (2004) | Recommender: Both funny but will also give you that action adrenaline | User: I've actually seen both of those and found them to be amazing. It was a nice break from regular zombie films like Dawn of the Dead  (2004) | Recommender: Agree! I like how creative the zombie genre can get! Have a great day, bud! I hope I did a good job at recommending | User: You did fantastic. Have a few movies to consider. Thank you!\nUser: Hi there! | Recommender: Hi what kind of movie would you like to watch today | User: I'm kind of bored. Was thinking about finding a good comedy to watch. Any ideas? | User: My favorite is Dumb and Dumber (1994) for what it's worth. | Recommender: The Hangover (2010) movies were great | Recommender: I like Dumb and Dumber too | User: I have seen the first two, but have not seen The Hangover Part III (2013) yet. | User: Might have to give that a look. Any other ideas? | User: Preferably something on Netflix. lol | Recommender: Fist Fight (2017) was funny | User: Nice. Will definitely look into that one. | Recommender: The Ridiculous 6 (2015) was good it has Adam Sandler and a netflix original | User: Netflix! That's perfect for me. I've always liked Adam Sandler's movies. Especially Happy Gilmore (1996). | User: I have a couple movies to consider. Thank you for your suggestions and I will definitely check them out. | Recommender: The movie was pretty good. Glad I could help. Have a good day. | User: You too. Take care!\nUser: hellloo | Recommender: Hey there! How's it going? | User: Not bad. How about you? Would you happen to know of an good comedies that came out recently? Along the lines of something like The Hangover (2009) ? I love that movie | Recommender: I'm doing okay. Have you by any chance seen the sequels The Hangover Part II (2011) and The Hangover Part III (2013)? | Recommender: I enjoyed the first one the most, but felt it the others were worth mentioning. | User: I have. The whole franchise. Can you think of anything similar to them? Similar to Bridesmaids  (2011) even, since they're of a similar vein | Recommender: Have you seen the new Ghostbusters  (2016)  yet? I thought that was a similar style of comedy. | Recommender: Otherwise if you're willing to go back over 20 years, I'd always recommend Dumb and Dumber (1994). | User: I haven't. I may check it out. I'm not a huge fan of Ghostbusters (1984) the original so I may actually like the remake lol | User: Oh that's a good suggestion. I was a kid when that came out so was too young to see it | User: I'll have to check it out | Recommender: Yeah, it's a much different style of comedy than the original so it might just be your thing! | Recommender: Definitely check it out. That and DodgeBall: A True Underdog Story (2004) are my two favorite comedies. | User: Thanks a lot bud! I'll probably watch Dumb and Dumber (1994) tonight! Thanks for bringing that up! I hope you enjoy the rest of your day! | Recommender: You as well buddy.
