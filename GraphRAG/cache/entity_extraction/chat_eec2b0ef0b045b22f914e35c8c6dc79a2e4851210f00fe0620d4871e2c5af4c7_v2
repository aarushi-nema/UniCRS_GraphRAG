Coco  (2017) is a newer movie and really cute. | User: Sure. Some animated films are great. I loved Finding Nemo (2003) | User: I haven't seen your suggestion but I'll look into it. | Recommender: Or there is Jumanji  (2017).  It would be as good as the original, except it doesn't have Robin Williams. :( | User: Yes you are right about that. It was very sad when that news came out. I will make sure to watch that movie as well. | User: I really liked Robin Williams in Schindler's List (1993) | Recommender: If you like comedy, you could try Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri (2017). | User: I've heard of that. I'll definitely be watching. Thank you for your help | Recommender: I think I liked Robin Williams in everything he was ever in.  One of the greats. | Recommender: Okay, have a good night! | User: You too. Thanks a bunch!\nRecommender: Hi! | User: Hello. | Recommender: What kind of movies are you looking for tonight? | User: I'm looking for some new movies to watch with my family. We're all adults so I don't need to worry about being suitable for children. | User: We all watched Men in Black  (1997)  recently and very much enjoyed it. | Recommender: Okay, great.  Have you seen Logan  (2017) or Wonder Woman  (2017)? | User: Yes. I have seen both those. Logan  (2017)  was another one we all watched together. We are big fans of Marvel. | Recommender: Have you seen Wonder  (2017) yet?  I think that one was recently released on DVD. | User: I have not. I don't think I've even heard of it. I will check that out since I'm sure no one else has seen it either. | Recommender: Not sure if your family likes romantic comedy, but the Reese Witherspoon movie Home Again (2017) is out on DVD. | User: That might be something for my mother and I to watch together. The men aren't normally into Romance, which is probably normal. | User: Thank you for the suggestions. | Recommender: Have you seen Jumanji  (2017)? | Recommender: Hopefully one of those suggestions will work for you. | User: No. That one is on the list to watch now too. I think we will enjoy it. | User: Thanks so much for your help. | User: Have a good night.\nRecommender: Hello. Is there anything in particular I could help you with tonight? | User: Hi. I'm looking for movies that have some connection with mathematics, if that makes sense. | Recommender: The two that immediately come to mind are Hidden Figures (2016)  and A Beautiful Mind  (2001) | Recommender: Good Will Hunting (1997)  is another one I've just thought of. I really liked that movie. | User: Oh, good choice. I was amused when Matt Damon solved the 'unsolvable' problem. | Recommender: The Man Who Knew Infinity  (2015) was a beautiful movie. | Recommender: I found that amusing as well. Especially since I had just watched the same actor in Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back (2001) | User: Wasn't that Ramanujan in that film? | User: Was he also in Jay and Silent Bob? Kevin Smith makes great movies, IMO! | Recommender: He does. I have watched them all. | Recommender: Yes Ramanujan was the subject of the movie | User: There was also a movie I saw a couple years ago -- I'm forgetting the name -- but it's where these aliens come to earth and communicate with, like, giant ink blots. | Recommender: I can't think of what that was. Maybe I did not see it. The movie I was actually thinking of dealing with numbers and aliens is something with Nicholas Cage but I can't think of the title of it either. | Recommender: Now I got it. It was Knowing  (2009) . Great movie but I'll never watch it again. It was too heart wrenching. | Recommender: I hope some of these suggestions helped you out. | User: Yes, I remember Knowing  (2009) : it was suprisingly deep for a Nic Cage movie. | User: Yes, these were useful suggestions: thanks for helping me! | Recommender: You're welcome. Have a good night. | User: Good night.\nUser: Hello! | Recommender: Hi, what kind of movies do you like? I'd be happy to suggest some. | User: Great!  Can you suggest a good family movie?  Either something animated like Zootopia would be fine, or live action like A Dog's Purpose  (2017).  I liked both of those. | Recommender: Have you seen The Incredibles (2004)? That's animated and good for family. | User: That's a good suggestion!  We haven't seen that one yet! | Recommender: What about Toy Story (1995)? It's a classic. | User: I have seen that one, and loved it! | User: You're right, it's a classic. | Recommender: I really liked Moana  (2016), you should give that a try too. It's also animated. | User: Okay, thanks for the suggestions!  I appreciate\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}], "parameters": {"model": "gpt-3.5-turbo", "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "temperature": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0}}}
