What sort of movie are you looking for? | User: I am interested in scary movies | Recommender: You are in luck because I love scary movies!  Have you seen The Babadook (2014) yet? | User: No, I haven't even heard of it! | User: I just looked it up and it looks good | Recommender: It was!  You should also check out The Witch  (2015).  It was surprisingly good. | User: That looks like a good one too! | Recommender: I would also recommend Martyrs  (2016) if you do not mind gory gory movies. | Recommender: It is pretty graphic. | User: Haha, okay, I might not be able to get through Martyrs  (2016) | Recommender: tucker and dale vs evil was funny and scary simultaneously. It  (2017) was pretty good! | User: I've heard a lot about It  (2017) . I read the book and liked it so I definitely need to watch the movie. | User: Thanks for all the suggestions! | Recommender: Of course!  Good bye!\nRecommender: Hello. Are you searching for anything specific? | User: Hey!  I just watched Wonder Woman  (2017) and am seeking other strong female lead movies! | User: Any suggestions? | Recommender: The first movie that came to mind is actually Resident Evil  (2002)  but that isn't really the same thing. I'll think about it for a second. | Recommender: Have you ever seen Black Swan  (2010) ? | User: I saw that movie and thought it was pretty good.  Never played the game too much, though! | User: I did and I enjoyed it! | Recommender: Same here. I didn't really like the game. I would consider Lady Bird  (2017)  a strong female lead, although she is young. | User: I have not seen that!  But I really  want to.  I like the director quite a bit. | Recommender: I have heard a lot about that. I don't pay much attention to directors but I know that movie is up for a bunch of awards. | User: Thank you for reminding me of that movie!  I will have to make an effort to see it now!\nRecommender: Hey, what kind of films are you looking for? | User: Hello. Do you have anything interesting in mind? I'm open to any suggestions really. | User: The movies I watch tend to all be from Marvel so I have lost track of other genres. | Recommender: I love marvel movies!  Did you see Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2 (2017) ? | User: I haven't actually watched it yet. I have watched the first one Guardians of the Galaxy  (2014) | User: I liked it a lot and I'm very excited for the upcoming merge into the Avengers storyline in Production of Avengers: Infinity War and the untitled Avengers sequel | Recommender: Both were excellent!  I've enjoyed a lot of the more recent super hero movies.  Wonder Woman  (2017) was amazing. | Recommender: Oh me too!! | Recommender: I am especially excited about Black Panther (2018) | User: Yes it was. I loved that Gal Gadot was the star. I am interested in Black Panther (2018)  too. I'm not familiar with that character's story so it will be interesting. | User: The sequel to Ant-Man  (2015)  is coming too I think. | Recommender: That should be good too. | User: Thanks for your help. I can stay focused on the new Marvel films coming up so I don't lose track of them.\nRecommender: Hello. Are you looking for anything specific? | User: Hey! Would you happen to know any good movies? | User: Something along the lines of Jumanji  (2017) | User: Brilliant movie thats killing at the box office | Recommender: I have never actually watched Jumanji  (2017) but I'll try. | User: Good film really | Recommender: I know The Shape of Water  (2017)  did well and I liked it a great deal. | User: Another movie I really liked was The Truman Show (1998) | User: Oh I havent yet seen The Shape of Water  (2017) but i love the director | User: I think I may just watch that one tonight. | User: Thank you so much for your help today! | Recommender: Have you ever watched Hook  (1991) ? | Recommender: You're welcome. | User: Loved that film!\nRecommender: Hey there! | User: Hey!
