Because I feel like they say that title in the line of one of the songs. Also, I'm embarrassed to say I have never seen a Star Wars movie at all! | User: I'll have to get on both of those suggestions though, I suppose it's time ;) Sci-fi is like action really | Recommender: Definitely see at least the first three Star Wars movies. They are great. | User: Thanks for all of the wonderful movies to add to my list, I appreciate it! | Recommender: You got it. Later! | User: I will start at the beginning, and work to the new ones, wish me luck! | User: Later!\nRecommender: hey | User: Hello! | Recommender: How can I help? | User: I'm looking for some comedy, or horror movies to watch tonight...like Idle Hands (1999) or Half Baked (1998) | Recommender: Sixteen Candles (1984) and Home Alone (1990) were great 80's classics. | Recommender: Or you might try Real Genius (1985) and Weird Science  (1985) e for some laughs. | User: Ooh, I've yet to see Sixteen Candles (1984) but have been told to watch it, so I'll add that to the list! I love all of the Home Alone  movies, but mostly the first 2 of them. Home Alone 3 (1997) was alright, but I didn't care for Home Alone 4 much at all. | User: I haven't seen Real Genius (1985) or Weird Science  (1985) but I've been told to watch those as well, as the names seem familiar. Thanks for the great suggestions! | User: I really appreciate the help! | Recommender: These should give you some movies to watch this weekend. | Recommender: You are welcome. | Recommender: Have a great weekend! | User: Of course! This helps with these snow day blues for sure! You have a great weekend as well, take care!\nRecommender: Hello! | User: Hello! | Recommender: Can I help you find some movies to watch? :) | User: Looking for a good comedy or action movie | Recommender: Okay, have you seen The Golden Compass  (2007) It's a bit of a mix between action, comedy, and drama / adventure. | User: No I haven't | Recommender: But for good comedy, I would recommend Grumpy Old Men  (1993) and Grumpier Old Men (1995) | User: Awesome! I haven't seen either one of those! | Recommender: As far as more action oriented, you can't go wrong with Bad Boys  (1995) or Bad Boys II (2003) | User: Love Bad Boys  (1995) and Bad Boys II (2003) ! | Recommender: They are great old slapstick comedies, Grumpy Old Men  (1993) comes first, followed by Grumpier Old Men (1995) great back to back flicks! | User: Two of my favorite movies | Recommender: I always was a fan of the Bad Boys  movies too! | User: Same here! | User: Thanks for all your help today! | Recommender: How about S.W.A.T.  (2003) ? | User: Yes! | User: Love that movie | User: Haven't seen it in years though | Recommender: You're welcome, I hope the suggestions take care of your movie needs! S.W.A.T.

What kind of movies do you like? | User: Hi there!  I am looking forward to Ready Player One  (2018) at the end of the month and I really liked Tomorrowland  (2015) | Recommender: Hm, let me see... | Recommender: Have you seen The Rocketeer  (1991) ? | User: I have that was a really cute movie too.  It was fun.  I also liked The Host  (2013) | Recommender: Is that a horror flick? | User: Kind of - I guess it could be considered horror.  I read the books though and it felt more sci fi than horror to me | Recommender: Ah. Host... so someone taking over someone else, or a parasitic relationship? | Recommender: Have you seen the original Invasion of the Body Snatchers (1956) ? It's great. | User: Yeah it and The Host  (2013)  have the same premise.
