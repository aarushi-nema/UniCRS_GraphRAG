I am willing to take a chance. I like classics too, like the The Quiet Man (1952) | Recommender: I have never seen that one. | User: I have never see Troll  (1986) . Is it like The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers (2002) ? | User: I like the Quiet man. It  has John Wayne. You know, from The Searchers  (1956) . | Recommender: No, it is very different. It is about a little girl that becomes a troll, and her family doesn't realize it, but the brother finds out. The troll is the antagonist. | User: Oh, I thought it might be like Trolls  (2016) where the Trolls are good guys. | User: Have you seen an romance movies lately? | Recommender: No, it isn't a cartoon. It is just a fantasy movie. | Recommender: I have seen Walk Like a Man  (1987) | User: I do not think I have seen that one. | Recommender: That was a good one with Howie Mandel. He was raised by wolves and has to learn to be human. | User: Have you ever saw Howie Mandel in Little Monsters (1989) ? | Recommender: Yes, that was a good one. | Recommender: Hopefully, I gave you some suggestions. | Recommender: I hope that I helped. | User: Yes you did.

It was so cool when it came out, but all my friends got motion sickness. | Recommender: The Texas Chain Saw Massacre (1974) however was a classic. | User: That was a great one | Recommender: I saw that they have The Texas Chainsaw Massacre: The Beginning (2006) on Crackle right now also. | Recommender: Friday the 13th  (1980) was another scary classic. | User: Yeah I agree | User: Nice chatting with you. Bye. | Recommender: Halloween  (1978) I think was Jamie Lee Curtis' first film. | Recommender: Thanks.

Like Planes, Trains and Automobiles (1986) ? | Recommender: Or something like The Jerk (1979) ? | User: I like some older ones. I haven't seen that one. | User: My spouse likes that movie though. | Recommender: What is your favorite comedy? | User: I don't know. I like Billy Madison (1995). It's kind of dumb funny, but I like it. | Recommender: I love all Sandler's stuff. What about Little Nicky (2000) ? | User: The Longest Yard  (2005) was good too. | User: Yeah, I have seen that one. | Recommender: Did you like Little Nicky? | User: It was okay. | Recommender: I liked the older Longest Yard too. With Burt Reynolds. | User: I really want to see that. | Recommender: Have you seen Sandler in Spanglish  (2004) ? | User: I might have. Is that where he falls for the maid? | Recommender: Yes it is. It is more of a love story. | Recommender: Well, I think I have some good comedies to think about now. Do you have one more I should give a try ? | User: I wish that he had newer movies. I might just watch the older The Longest Yard  (1974)  that you talked about earlier. | User: Thank you.\nUser: Hello | Recommender: hi | User: What kind of movies can you recommend? My favorite right now is Hellraiser (1987) | Recommender: How about Friday the 13th  (1980) or Halloween  (1978) both great older ones. | User: Those are both classics | Recommender: Hellraiser: Inferno (2000) was another one worthy of watching. | User: I enjoy both of those a lot and Inferno was pretty good too. I only don't like the newest Hellraiser movie. | Recommender: You might check out The Ring  (2002) if you want a good one. | User: I like that one. I saw it in theaters | User: Thanks for those good recommendations | Recommender: I don't know how many sequels there were to that one but i know there were more. | Recommender: That should get you started.
