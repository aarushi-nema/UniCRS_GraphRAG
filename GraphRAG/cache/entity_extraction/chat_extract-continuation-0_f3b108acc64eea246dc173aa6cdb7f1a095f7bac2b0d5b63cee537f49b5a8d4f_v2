Did you like it? | Recommender: The Martian  (2015) is really good too though I don't know if either of those qualify as action | Recommender: I did.  I've watched it a couple of times now | User: I did see The Martian  (2015), it was really good. | Recommender: Maybe Space Cowboys (2000) ?  I liked that one too. | User: I like Chris Pratt, he was good in The Magnificent Seven  (2016). | Recommender: I've seen that one that's a really good movie too! | User: Can't really go wrong with Denzel. | Recommender: My husband like Cowboys & Aliens (2011) .

No way it could. They should have just done something in that universe but not a remake. | Recommender: Well they kinda put some political silliness in there that really was pointless.
