What type of movie are you interested in? | User: I like comedies. | Recommender: Have you seen Little Nicky (2000) ? | User: Yes | Recommender: I really enjoyed Thor: Ragnarok (2017) it has quite a bit of humor in it. | User: I haven't seen that one.  I'm not big into the comic book movies, but maybe I'll check it out. | User: What's your favorite movie? | Recommender: My favorite of all time is The Notebook (2013) | User: That's a good one. I like it. | User: I have a few favorites.  One of them is Forrest Gump (1994) | Recommender: Another great movie is Bedtime Stories  (2008) | User: That is a good one. | Recommender: Forrest Gump (1994) is a fantastic movie. Did you see Patch Adams  (1998) ? | User: I think I saw it.  It's been a while. | Recommender: It's not exactly a complete comedy, but I enjoyed it. | User: Still good. | User: What kind of movies do you like? | Recommender: I enjoy romantic comedies or christian movies. Have you seen God's Not Dead  (2014) ? | User: Oh yes. | User: I thought it was good.  It wasn't great, but good enough. | Recommender: I'm really looking forward to seeing A Wrinkle in Time  | User: I don't know.  I liked the book and I'd like to see it adapted into a movie, but I'm not sure about this one. | Recommender: I hope it's good. Most of the time movies made from books aren't the greatest. Did you see Ender's Game  (2013) ? | User: No, I haven't.  Have you? | Recommender: I did. It wasn't good, it was loosely based on the book at best. | User: Yeah, that happens a lot. | Recommender: It does. A movie I always watch when I can't find something else is Stardust  (2007) it is a fantastic silly movie. | User: It's okay. | User: The last movie I watched was National Velvet  on TV the other night.  What about you? | Recommender: I saw the new Jumanji  (2017) a few weeks ago. It was pretty good. Today my children's made me sit through Moana  (2016) | User: Did you not like it? | User: I haven't seen Moana yet. | Recommender: I liked Jumanji  (2017)  for what it was. Moana  (2016) is great it is far better than the other recent Disney movies, however 100 plus times on a movie is my limit. | User: I understand that! | Recommender: I suppose there are far worse things to complain of. Have you seen Lady in the Water (2006)? It was one of my favorite movies a couple years ago. | User: I can't recall that I have. | User: Maybe I should watch it. | Recommender: It's by M. Night Shamalan, and not super suspenseful, but I loved the story. | Recommender: I think I remember hearing that it is based on a bed time story he told his kids. | User: Interesting. | Recommender: You should check it out. | User: I should.  I've liked some of his movies. | Recommender: I imagine that it is available streaming somewhere. | User: Most likely. | Recommender: Awesome! Well I should let you go, I hope you enjoy the movie! | User: I hope I do, too! Thanks for the suggestion.\nUser: Hi. | Recommender: Hello, how are you today? I'm you're (unqualified) movie recommender! | User: Funny, I'm good. How are you? | Recommender: Is there anything in particular you are looking for, or should I just start naming movies I like and why? | User: Go for it. | Recommender: Well, to start, I'd like the recommend The Matrix (1999) for it's sci-fi themes, though it's better to think of people as computers as it was originally intended. | User: One of my favorites. | Recommender: If you're looking for some action Iron Man  (2008) has perhaps the best mix of music and action with it's Black Sabbath scene. | Recommender: Patema Inverted is an animated feature that is great for questioning your own biases. | User: I have never heard of that one. | Recommender: The Shadow  (1994) is a great (corny) film if you want to watch Alec Baldwin as a &quot;dark&quot; superhero. | User: I remember that one. I had completely forgotten about that. Alec is great, I loved him as Jack Donaghy on 30Rock | Recommender: He's a great straight-man kind of comedic actor. | User: So true | User: Well thanks, this is a great list. | User: Have a great day! | Recommender: Well, that's a list that should get you going. Have a nice day!\nUser: Hey, I am looking for a movie to watch this weekend. It doesn't have to be in theaters currently.
