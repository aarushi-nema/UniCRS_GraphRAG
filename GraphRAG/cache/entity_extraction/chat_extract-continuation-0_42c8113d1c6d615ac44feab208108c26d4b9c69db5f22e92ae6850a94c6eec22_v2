It's about a family that takes a road trip and they have a lot of funny mishaps along the way. But there's a lot of drama thrown in throughout the movie. | User: Sounds like I'd enjoy that. I'll check it out later today | User: Thanks for the suggestions! | Recommender: You're welcome. Have a good day.\nUser: Hello | Recommender: Hello, what kind of movies are you looking for? | User: Im looking for a good horror. Has to be something on DVD I can pickup later this after noon. | Recommender: Ok, are you open to classic horrors or just more recent ones? | User: either or. | User: A good movie knows no time period | Recommender: That's right. Have you seen The Omen (1976) ? | User: No, but I saw the remake a few years ago. | User: How is it? | Recommender: I haven't seen the remake, so I can't compare the two. But, the original is really good and keeps you in suspense until the end. | Recommender: What about Psycho  (1960)? It's a classic Hitchcock film. | User: Sounds interesting. I saw the latest version and enjoyed it, so I'm sure I'll love the original. | User: Any classics featuring vampires or strange creatres? | Recommender: Oh yeah. I love the classics. Have you seen Cat People  (1942) ? | User: No I haven't. | User: Is it gory? I can't do much gore. | Recommender: No gore. It's a really good classic. It's about a woman that turns into a cat when she falls in love with a man and she ends up killing him. | User: WHAAT!?! Sounds suspenseful. :) | User: and a little sad, lol | Recommender: Yeah, it is. She warned him not to make her fall in love, but he didn't listen. I assume you've probably seen the original Dracula  (1931) ? | User: &quot;sighs&quot;.... I have not. I'm so embarrassed, lol. | Recommender: Oh wow. You definitely need to. Bela Lugosi is so good as Dracula. | User: I am one of those people who used to dismiss older movies because of the quality of film making, but as I've grown older, I see that they often tell much better stories than films today | Recommender: Oh yeah, definitely. A more recent one that you might like is Paranormal Activity (2007). | User: My son's seen them all. Swears they're good horror without a lot of cheesey special effects. | Recommender: Eh, it was ok. You could kind of tell it was fake, though. Well, is that enough suggestions, or would like more? | User: Well he swears they're aawesome, lol. And these are good. I think I have enough to work with . | User: Thank you so much! | Recommender: You're welcome!\nRecommender: Hello, what kind of movies are you looking for? | User: Hi! | User: I'm looking for some good films noir. | Recommender: Ooh my favorite genre. Have you seen Scarlet Street (1945) with Edward G. Robinson and Joan Bennett? | User: No I haven't. | Recommender: It's so good. It's on Youtube if you'd like to watch it. What about The Woman in the Window ? | User: I have seen that one. As well as Father of the Bride  (1950) | User: I've also enjoyed The Reckless Moment (1949) | Recommender: I like Father of the Bride  (1950) . I haven't seen The Reckless Moment (1949) , though. | User: It's pretty good. James Mason is in it | User: He's so handsome! | Recommender: I'll have to check it out! Is that enough recommendations, or would you like more? | User: One more if you've got one. | Recommender: I really like @Double Indemnity with Barbara Stanwyck and Fred MacMurray. | User: I haven't seen that. Sounds like a murder mystery by the title. | Recommender: Yep, it sure is. I won't give it away, but it's really good. | User: Okay, I'll check some of these out this evening. You've been a great help to me. :) | Recommender: You're welcome!\nRecommender: Hello, what kind of movie are you looking for? | User: I'm looking for a film of any genre, with a woman in the lead. | User: I'm in the mood for a good heroine today. :) | Recommender: Have you seen The Blind Side  (2009) with Sandra Bullock? | User: No I have not. | User: That's the one about her adopting the black kid right? | Recommender: Yeah, it's really good. | Recommender: What about The Help  (2011) with Emma Stone and Viola Davis? | User: I'll rent it tonight. | User: I did see that.
