There's Jurassic World (2015) , the new series following up the original Jurassic Park movies, which has Chris Pratt and is awesome. | User: You'd think it would be obvios, but I haven | Recommender: Or Dinosaur  (2000) would be an obvious one, it's a fun movie for all ages! | User: *haven't actually seen Jurassic World (2015). It looks good. | User: What is Dinosaur  (2000) about? | Recommender: It's a dinosaur (raised by lemurs) who has to deal with the meteors coming to earth.
