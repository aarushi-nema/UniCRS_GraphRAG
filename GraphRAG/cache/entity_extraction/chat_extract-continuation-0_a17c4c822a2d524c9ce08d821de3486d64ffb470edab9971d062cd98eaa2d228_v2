Saw III (2006) was probably my favorite | Recommender: I've seen the whole series myself. The only one I distinctly remember is Saw  (2004).

The first one is absolutely great! | Recommender: Jaws 3-D (1983) and Jaws: The Revenge (1987) were both pretty bad. | Recommender: Is there anything else I can help you with tonight?
