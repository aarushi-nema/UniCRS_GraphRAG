For more of a Jumanji  (2017) feel, you should try The Jungle Book  (2016) | Recommender: Or if you want a space adventure, try Zathura  (2005) | User: I saw The Jungle Book  (2016) with the little ones yesterday haha great film | User: Zathura  (2005) by the guy who did Iron Man  (2008) was brilliant | User: Zathura  (2005) by the guy who did Iron Man  (2008) was brilliant | User: Thank you so much you've been a great help | User: Bye | Recommender: Bye!\nUser: Hello. Are you at all familiar with movies based on books? | Recommender: Hello. How's your saturday? | Recommender: Yes indeed I am | User: My Saturday is going well. I hope yours is as well. | User: That's great. I'm looking for some good ones. | Recommender: Have you seen The Hunger Games  (2012) | User: Yes. I've seen those. They are really good. Much better than Twilight  (2008) , at least in my opinion. | Recommender: I didn't like the first but I found The Hunger Games: Catching Fire (2013) to be very good. | Recommender: My all time favorite book to movie series is Harry Potter though.  My personal favorite is Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban  (2004) | User: Those movies are very good. I enjoy them as well. I'm also a fan of The Lord of the Rings  , which may be one of the most well known. | Recommender: Ah I've never seen those. Another good one that's based on a book is The Shawshank Redemption (1994) . I love that film. So good | User: I will have to catch that one. I've actually not seen it yet. It is based on a Stephen King story right? | Recommender: Sure is! There are alot of good Stephen King book to film adaptions, but that one is my favorite | User: I will get that one for the weekend. Thank you for suggesting it. | Recommender: No problem! Enjoy the rest of your day, and have a great weekend! | User: You too!\nRecommender: hey! | User: hey. what's up | User: see any good movies lately? | Recommender: not much. whats your fav funny movie of 2017 | Recommender: mine is Girls Trip (2017) | User: Hmmm. I'll probably have to say Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri (2017) . Do you know of anything similar | Recommender: i have not seen that one, will have to look it up | User: I've seen Girls Trip (2017) as well. I liked it. I may see Jumanji  (2017) because of it, because they seem to have the same kind of wacky humor | Recommender: yes! i cannot wait to see Jumanji! that will be so funny. | User: Do you know of any other recent ones like Girls Trip (2017) | Recommender: what about Baywatch  (2017) | User: Ah. I was curious as to if that was good. Have you seen? Is it worth a watch? | Recommender: its hillarious. i love it, id watch it again, | User: Definitely going to have to check it out. Thanks so much | User: Have a great rest of the day, and Super Bowl weekend! | Recommender: np! thanks for talking to me\nUser: hey. how are ya | Recommender: Hello. I am doing well. Yourself? | Recommender: Is there anything specific you are looking for? | User: not bad at all. see any good movies lately? | User: I'm up for any genre | Recommender: The last movie I watched that I really enjoyed was Suicide Squad  (2016) although I was a little late to the game with that. | Recommender: I was surprised at how much I liked it. I also watched Dunkirk  (2017)  recently and enjoyed it as well. | User: Ah! I may check it out. I've been hestitant with DC movies since I didn't like Man of Steel  (2013) that much | Recommender: Exactly. I didn't watch it because I was not a fan of other DC movies. I'm much more of a marvel fan. The Avengers  (2012) is still one of my favorities. | User: Dunkirk  (2017) k was great. Reminds me of Saving Private Ryan (1998) | User: I've seen all of the marvel movies minus Ant-Man  (2015). Would you recommend? | Recommender: That wasn't one of the best, in my opinion. I think you should watch anyway though so you don't miss any pieces of the story. I watched Guardians of the Galaxy  (2014) recently in preparation for their merge with the Avengers as well. | User: I can't wait until the next film! Thanks so much for the Suicide Squad  (2016) suggestion. I may finally give it a shot | User: It was nice talking to you bud! Have a great superbowl weekend! | Recommender: You're welcome. The Joker in that movie was awesome. I hope you enjoy it.\nUser: hey there | Recommender: Hi there.
