You have a great night too!\nRecommender: Hello, how are you today? | User: I am okay. Feeling pretty tired after a long day. Action movies always keep me entertained and upbeat. Know any good ones? | Recommender: I know a few off top my head. Die Hard (1988)  is a great action movie | Recommender: That and Looper  (2012) are good Bruce Willis Flicks. | User: I have heard so much about the Die hard franchise but I've never seen all of them | User: I've seen Looper, it was alright. | Recommender: If you are in the mood for a good story Pan's Labyrinth (2006) is a real kicker. | User: That movie was amazing. I love the creatures in it. Such an amazingly put together movie. | User: Any others like that? | Recommender: Die Hard Franchise was great back in the day. Die Hard 2 (1990) and Live Free or Die Hard (2007) are half decent. | Recommender: Other's like Pan's Labyrinth (2006) that I can think off that is similar would be The Lord of the Rings  (1978) | Recommender: or The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring (2001) | Recommender: I agree Pan's Labyrinth (2006) was awesome! | User: Oh boy. Lord of the rings is like something I would avoid. Way too long for me plus I'm not a fan of the books so I'd fall asleep. I would probably only watch for Orlando Bloom. | User: Thank you for all off the suggestions. I might just check them all out in the end. | Recommender: Haha! I hear ya.

All those sequels are crap | Recommender: Haha okay | Recommender: Have you seen The Machinist (2004) or Predator  (1987) ? | Recommender: I liked Jurassic Park too | User: Never heard of The Machinist (2004). Predator  (1987)  was too violent for me.
