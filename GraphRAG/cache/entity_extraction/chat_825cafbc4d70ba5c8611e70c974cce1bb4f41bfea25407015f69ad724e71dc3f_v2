I'm hoping to find a movie that is thought-provoking or could spark a conversation after watching it.  Something like The Truman Show (1998) (what if you found out your whole life is a lie?) or Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind (2004) (would you choose to forget someone you had a bad relationship with?).  Both of those were great thoughto-provoking movies! | User: If you could suggest anything in a similar vein, that would be great! | Recommender: Thought provoking is always good!
