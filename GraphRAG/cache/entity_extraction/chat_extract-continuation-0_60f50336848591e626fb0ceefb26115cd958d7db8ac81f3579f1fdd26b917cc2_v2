Ocean's 11 (1960) is a classic for me | User: I don't think I've seen that one but saw a more recent one Ocean's Thirteen (2007) | Recommender: That's a good one!

It  (2017) was a really good one. Maybe something like that? | Recommender: Well yes but I also recommend you first watch It  (1966) before you watch It  (2017) , so that way you can make a comparison. | User: That sounds like a good idea. What about The Shining  (1980) ? | Recommender: Also have you seen Annabelle  (2014) , it is definitely worth it, since its based on a true story. | User: I think I will try that one.
