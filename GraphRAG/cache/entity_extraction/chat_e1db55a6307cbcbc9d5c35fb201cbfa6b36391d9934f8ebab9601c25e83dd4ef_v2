Can you give me some info about it? What makes it a good script? | User: Well it's a Quintin Tarentino movie, and it was very dialogue heavy and witty. | Recommender: Got it - I love Quintin Tarentiono movies as well. | User: What's your favorite of his? | Recommender: Have you seen Pulp Fiction (1994) ? | Recommender: I also really like Reservoir Dogs (1992) .

What is it about? | Recommender: It is very similar to The Lego Movie (2014) , but all about Batman and Robin. | User: Is it anything like Batman Begins ? | Recommender: No.  Because it is Lego, and a bit of a parody. | User: Or Batman and Robin  (1949) ? | User: Great - Thanks! | Recommender: How about Batman Beyond: Return of the Joker ? | Recommender: that is family friendly | User: Sounds perfect - Thank you! | User: Have a grat day! | Recommender: you too!\nRecommender: Hi how are you? | User: I'm great, thank you.

I really need to check out that movie though, because I have one of those MoviePasses and am always looking for highly rated movies, missed this one! | Recommender: I personally saw Mother! (2017)  recently and I really recommend it if you like alternative horror films. | User: I hated Mother! (2017) ! I wanted to walk out but my friend forced me to stay based on the tine I forced her to see Little Man  (2006) | Recommender: Oh gosh, you subjected her to torture. The last movie I walked out on was Murder on the Orient Express (2017). | User: It was torture! It was stupid I couldn't leave. Mother! (2017) bothered me on multiple levels.

I tend to see a lot of films on planes as I travel overseas every couple of weeks. I have watched Jackie  (2016) multiple times recently. Have you seen it? | Recommender: I haven't.
