It's good, but not as good as the previous movies in the franchise. | Recommender: You mean Saw  (2004) ? | User: Yes. Those movies are better in my opinion. | User: I've also seen It  (2017) . It's a remake of the original. It's pretty good. Especially if you liked the original. | Recommender: I like them both | Recommender: But what can I recommend for you? | User: Hmm... now that we've been talking about suspense, I want something in that genre to watch. | Recommender: lol I understand. Well what about Get Out (2017) ? It's not very horrific but it's good and psychological. | User: I've seen it. I didn't like it as much as I would thought. | User: I thought it would have been more like The Bone Collector (1999) . | Recommender: I see. Well in that case you want to check out Zodiac  (2007) . That's very good. Very similar to Denzel's film but it's about the BTK killer | User: Is it gory? | Recommender: Not at all. There are a few violent scenes but the movies is mainly a deep mystery | User: Okay then. I'll probably like that one. | User: Thanks for your help today! | Recommender: You're welcome. Enjoy!\nUser: Hi there!! | Recommender: Hello! | Recommender: What kind of movie are you looking for? | User: I'm in the mood for a good horror film today. | User: Can you help me? | Recommender: Yes. Have you seen The Babadook (2014) ? It's very unique and a bit odd but overall very scary | User: No I haven't. But I've heard good things about it. That's its very psychological | Recommender: I loved it! Have you seen A Tale of Two Sisters (2003) | Recommender: I also liked that one. I thought it was super scary | Recommender: And of course, there is The Shining  (1980) but I'm sure you've seen it | User: Yes, I've seen The Shining  (1980) . I wonder why they don't make horror films as suspenseful anymore. | User: Maybe because we're so de-sensitized to everything. | Recommender: I don't know. It's very frustrating. The new ones all seem to have little plot | Recommender: I also would recommend Hush  (2016) . | User: I agree. They seem to be more about jumps and scares than anything | Recommender: Have you seen that one? | User: No I have not | User: Is it good? | User: A good plot i mean | Recommender: You should check it out! I thought it had a very indepth plot that moved at a good pace | Recommender: I watched it with my grandfather and he enjoyed it too | User: I'll definitely take a look. Thanks :) | Recommender: No worries! Have a great day | Recommender: I hope you like it\nRecommender: Hi | User: Hello | User: How are you? | Recommender: What would you like to see? | Recommender: I’m great.
