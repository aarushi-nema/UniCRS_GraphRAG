A Quiet Place (2018) is creepy! | User: I liked Get Out (2017) even though it was a little bit weird | User: I haven't seen, For sure i will try that one | User: Even its name sounds interesting | User: Would you recommend anything else? | Recommender: You Were Never Really Here looks good too, but I only saw the previews. | User: I have not heard about it, is it scary? | User: I will add to my next movies i will see | User: Thanks, have a nice day | User: I liked you suggestions, good bye | User: Remember to say good bye at the end! | Recommender: OK, take care!\nRecommender: Hi! | User: Hey | Recommender: What sort of movies do you like, good sir or madam? | User: I'm looking for time travel movies like Looper  (2012) | Recommender: Ah! | Recommender: Let me think.... there is always the classic The Time Machine  (1960) if you like older flicks. | User: Hm, I've never heard of that. I'll check it out | Recommender: And there is the goofball time travel movie Bill & Ted's Excellent Adventure (1989) lol | User: Oh yeah, I've seen that. Great movie! | Recommender: But if you want a VERY serious time travel movie ful of science and brain twists, you could try Primer  (2004) | Recommender: It is almost TOO serious but it is really good | User: Dang, I haven't heard of that either | Recommender: I think one of my favorites is good old Back to the Future (1985) | User: Yes, that's my favorite movie! | Recommender: There are a lot of good time travel movies out there | Recommender: HAha! Me too!!! | Recommender: Good tlaking to you! Hope you have some good suggestions | User: Thanks, have a good one\nRecommender: Hello! What kind of movies are you looking for today? | User: Hi! I'm looking for something scary. My favorite is Saw  (2004) | Recommender: I'm not super familiar with scary movies. I have a friend who loves them and prefers the classics like A Nightmare on Elm Street (1984) and Bride of Chucky (1998) | User: Oh yeah, I've seen A Nightmare on Elm Street (1984) and loved it, but not any of the Chucky movies. | User: I'll have to check out Chucky. What about something like a thriller? I'm a huge fan of Taken  (2008) | Recommender: I havent seen Taken but I did enjoy Inception (2010) which is a thriller in sort of a different vein | User: Oh, that one was good. A lot of odd filming techniques in that. | User: Can you think of any others? | Recommender: Thrillers like Inception (2010) I would also suggest Gravity  (2013) as well. | User: Very good. I haven't seen Gravity yet. I've been waiting to get a big TV for it. | User: Thank you for the recommendations.

Is it like Super Size Me (2004)  or more like Cowspiracy (2014) ? | Recommender: I loved Super Size Me, and it's a little like that but with more focus on farming and the evil Monsanto company. | User: I'll definitely check it out. | Recommender: Have you seen Making a Murderer on Netflix? That was a crazy series | User: Yep. Loved it. Love crime documentaries. | Recommender: So good. I love a good documentary, how about a political one?
