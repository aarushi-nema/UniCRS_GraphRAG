I can help you find a comedy or a horror.  Will either of those work for you? | User: Yes. I love horror movies. | Recommender: For example Mother! (2017) was really good.  It was a bit chilling but it left me on the edge of my seat wondering what was going to happen. | User: Is that the movie where there is something like a ghost pursuing the family? I haven't seen it but I've been around other people watching it. | Recommender: The Shining  (1980) ng is a great classic with Jack Nicholson.  I don't think there is any movie that is any scarier. | User: That's a great suggestion. I will definitely watch that one. | Recommender: No, The Mother is about a couple's relationship is tested when uninvited guests arrive at their home, disrupting their tranquil existence. | Recommender: It gets pretty hairy at time because of jealousy | User: I see. That sounds interesting too. | User: I will watch both of those. | Recommender: Sounds great.  I'm glad you liked the recommendations.  Goodbye | User: Thanks for your help. | User: Good night.\nUser: Hi there. | Recommender: Hello, what kind of movies do you like? | User: I'm looking for a Heist movie like The Italian Job  (2003) or Logan Lucky (2017) . | User: I watched Logan Lucky (2017) last night and it was really good. | Recommender: Have you seen Ocean's Thirteen (2007) or any of that series? | User: I have seen the first one, but not the most recent one. | User: Is it any good? | Recommender: Yes, they all are great.  Then there's The Town  (2010) with Ben Affleck. | User: I haven't seen that one either, but I do like Ben Affleck. | Recommender: Inside Man (2006) and Die Hard (1988) are good. | User: I haven't seen Inside Man (2006) , but I have seen Die Hard (1988)  and loved it. | User: I think I'll check out The Town  (2010) and Ocean's Thirteen (2007) . THanks for the suggestions. | Recommender: Then there's Inception (2010) and The Italian Job  (2003) -- all good heist movies. | User: Yes those were both really good. | User: Hope you have a great night.  :) | Recommender: Thank you, you also.  Bye | User: Bye.\nRecommender: HI what kind of movie do you want to see ? | Recommender: a romantic movie like Love Actually (2003) ? | User: I'm not looking for any genre in particular, just anything interesting. I recently watched and enjoyed Children of Men (2006) | User: I also liked The Shape of Water  (2017) . I hate romantic comedies honestly. Sorry. I'm not familiar with them at all. | Recommender: District 9 (2009) is sci-fi like Children of Men (2006) and Pan's Labyrinth (2006) is from the guy who made The Shape of Water  (2017) | User: Those are great suggestions. I've seen District 9 (2009)  but I didn't know the other movie was the same director. | User: I'll definitely watch it as soon as possible. | Recommender: also Blade Runner 2049 (2017) is also a good sci-fi movie, and its sequel Blade Runner (1982) | User: I have to watch Blade Runner 2049 (2017) . I'll get it soon. Thank you for mentioning it. | User: Thanks for all of your help. I appreciate the suggestions. They are all very good ones. | Recommender: and Kagemusha (1980) is an medieval japanese dram which is definitively not a romantic comedy | User: I never heard of it but I like all the other movies you mentioned so I will look that one up too. | User: Thanks so much. Have a good night.\nRecommender: Hey. | User: Hello | Recommender: Are you looking for a movie? | User: Yes, do you know of any psychological thriller movies?  I saw The Silence of the Lambs  (1991) and really liked it. | Recommender: Oh that's a good one. | Recommender: Have you seen Shutter Island  (2010) ? | User: Yes, that was good. | Recommender: How about Memento  (2000) ? | User: Haven't seen that one, is it good? | Recommender: Yes I really liked it.  I would also suggest Seven  (1995) if you haven't seen that one. | User: No, haven't seen that one either but I have heard really good things about it. | Recommender: It's a great movie. | Recommender: You should definitely check it out. | Recommender: I hope I've helped give you some good suggestions. | User: I will check Seven  (1995) out for sure, do you know of any others? | Recommender: Yes. | Recommender: How about Fight Club (1999) ?  That one is great! | User: No, haven't seen it, is it about boxing? | Recommender: Not really it's about a group of men that form an underground secret fighting club, but\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>MOTHER!
