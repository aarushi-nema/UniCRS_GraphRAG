Perhaps it is a day to revisit a classic romance? | User: Perhaps it is,  Have a great day\nRecommender: Good morning! | User: Morning! | Recommender: How are you today? | User: I'm swell. You? | Recommender: Shiny, thank you!  What can I help you find today? | User: Any good recommendations for drama movies? I'm out of the loop when it comes to those right now | Recommender: I've been a little behind on Drama, admittedly, but I think I've got a few for you. | Recommender: Are you into historical dramas, uplifting dramas? | User: Great! Umm lets go with historical dramas | Recommender: If you're into war films about pragmatic duty with an uplifting ending, Dunkirk  (2017) is really good. | User: I will definitely look into it. I haven't even heard of that one! | User: Do you know any good romance movies? | Recommender: I do.  Are you looking for something more recent, because my go-to for Romance is usually Shakespeare? | Recommender: But I can do a recent recommendation. | User: It doesn't matter! Have you watched the Romeo + Juliet (1996) with Leonardo DiCaprio? I liked it but I swear the whole ending where she literally opened her eyes and saw him drink the poison was just crazy lol | Recommender: Romeo + Juliet (1996) is the reason I auditioned for Tybalt last year.  I didn't get it, but I still got a fun part. | User: That's awesome! | Recommender: Okay, romance movies!  If you like Joss Whedon and can do another Shakespearean film (with a happy ending, I promise), look into Much Ado About Nothing  (2016) . | User: I will have to look into it. Have you seen any good ones on Netflix? | Recommender: The only thing I didn't like about it was that the black and white film and the costume choice made it hard to differentiate characters, but I still loved it. | Recommender: Okay, Netflix... | Recommender: I admit I've been neglecting my Netflix for a while, but I'll see what I can jog up. | User: Haha that's fine! If you can just think of any other it might be on there. | Recommender: Groovy.  :) | Recommender: How does Woody Allen suit you?  Because I'm thinking Midnight in Paris (2011) . | User: I love him! I've seen part of that one but will have to look into it more. Thanks so much for the suggestions! | Recommender: It's about a man who goes back to 1920s Paris and mingles with the artists of the time, which helps him cope with his 20th century obligations.  It also asks the question &quot;When were the good old days&quot;. | Recommender: Sweet!  I'm glad I could help.  Happy watching and take care!\nRecommender: Hi! | User: Hello! | Recommender: What movies are you interested in? | User: I tend to like animated movies. Some of my favorites are The Emperor's New Groove (2000) and Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood . | Recommender: Okay, I've seen a few animated. I also liked the Emperor. I really like A Goofy Movie (1995) as well | User: That was one of my favorites as a child! | User: Can you recommend any more recent animated movies? | Recommender: It's definitely a good one! Have you seen  The Lego Movie (2014) not super recent but it is good | User: Thanks! I've been meaning to watch that since I saw The Lego Batman Movie (2017) | Recommender: Or the new Captain Underpants: The First Epic Movie I loved the books as a kid | Recommender: Hope this helps! | User: Thanks! | User: I think that definitely helps. | Recommender: Great! Have a great day!\nRecommender: Hi. | User: Good morning! | User: How are you? | Recommender: I am great thanks. Excellent morning for a movie. Is there a particular genre you like? | User: I haven't seen a good documentary in a LONG time.  I generally prefer historical or environmental docs, but I can look into others as well. | Recommender: The first one that comes to mind for me is Blackfish  (2013) . Have you watched it? | User: I'm not sure if I've seen that one.  Is the about the orcas in Japan? | Recommender: It is about the killer whale Tilikum who was at SeaWorld. | User: Oh wait, I'm thinking The Cove  (2009) (which is a good one if you're into animal rights docs, but it's got a sad ending).  I haven't seen Blackfish  (2013), but I'd be down to give it a try. | Recommender: I haven't watched The Cove  (2009) . Blackfish  (2013) was surprisingly good...definitely eye opening. | User: Is there any animation you can recommend? | User: Not necessarily documentaries, mind you, lol. | Recommender: Another good one I have watched is Fahrenheit 9/11 (2004) which is a Michael Moore documentary. | User: Yes, I've see Fahrenheit 9/11. | User: It was pretty good. | User: Oops, forgot to at the &quot;at&quot; symbol. | Recommender:\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}], "parameters": {"model": "gpt-3.5-turbo", "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "temperature": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0}}}
