Marvel is more action than thriller. | User: Can you recommend thriller movies for that genre? | Recommender: Sinister  (2012) | User: More horror/paranormal, but that movie is okay. Not a big fan | User: Any other suggestions? | Recommender: The Silence of the Lambs  (1991) | User: That is a good thriller, I enjoyed that movie a lot. | Recommender: I am very scared when I watch | User: Understandable, Anthony Hopkins does a really good job portraying that character. | Recommender: I think he has mental illness | User: I mean he is a cannibal so I am sure he has a mental illness. | User: But thanks for the suggestions. Have a good day. Goodbye.\nUser: Hi there. Can you help me find some good christmas movies? | Recommender: Sure can! What time period? | User: Something old. Classic films | Recommender: Okay, well off the top of my head there's A Christmas Story (1983) . Can't go wrong with that one. | Recommender: Also there's It's a Wonderful Life (1946) . The black and white version. not the remakes | User: I happened to like the 94 version. lol | Recommender: Ugh! How could you? ;) | Recommender: I'd also recommend White Christmas  (1954) . It's a little &quot;musically&quot; but still good. | User: No, I can't do musicals. I can't stand the impromptu song and dance. Maybe if I were going to a theater performance but not in a film | Recommender: Okay then, how about Christmas in Connecticut (1945) with Barbara Stanwyck\n\nRead more at: http://www.nationalreview.com/article/454900/christmas-movies-five-black-and-white-classics? | User: What's that about? | Recommender: A Journalist in Connecticut who has to live a lie through the holiday.

Can you recommend some good dark Christmas movies? | Recommender: Dark Christmas? I'll give it a shot. | Recommender: Okay I've got a few! | Recommender: First up is A Christmas Horror Story (2015) | Recommender: This one is a collection of short films with dark Christmas themes. Krampus being one of them | Recommender: There's also Krampus  (2015) itself. It's good. My kids liked it. But it's just on the edge of scary/creepy. It doesn't do much to terrify you though | User: Is that the one with Stefania Owen? | User: And Toni Collette? | Recommender: It is. Have you seen it? | User: No but I've seen the first few minutes of it on HBO. Looked good but I fell asleep, lol | Recommender: There's also Santa's Slay (2005) . It's a cheesy slasher flick with Santa as the killer. | User: oh god! lol | Recommender: My thoughts exactly | Recommender: Last there's Silent Night, Deadly Night (1984) about a kid who goes on a homicidal rage dressed as Santa. Pretty decent | User: I think I've seen that one. But I'll cehck it out again to be sure. | User: Thanks for the suggestions friend! | Recommender: no probl. night!\nRecommender: Hi! | User: Hi there! | Recommender: What movies are you looking for? | User: I'm looking for some dark/horror christmas movies. | User: What can you recommend? | Recommender: Okay, there is Krampus  (2015)  which is horror christmas movie | User: I've seen it. I enjoyed it. Wish it were a bit scarier though | Recommender: Home for the Holidays  (1972) is a slasher christmas movie, if that sounds like something better, starring Sally fields | User: That does sound interesting. | User: And I love Sally Fields. | Recommender: She is an amazing actress!SoAnother slasher christmas movie is Black Christmas  (1974) which is another murder thriller horror movies for the holidays. | Recommender: Have you ever seen Silent Night, Deadly Night (1984) ? | User: Okay.
