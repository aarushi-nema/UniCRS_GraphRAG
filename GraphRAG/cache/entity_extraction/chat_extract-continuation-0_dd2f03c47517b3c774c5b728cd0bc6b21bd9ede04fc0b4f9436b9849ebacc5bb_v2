I haven't seen the sequel, though.  I'll have to look for that!  And maybe I'll watch the first one again, since it's been so long. | User: Frozen (2013) was great!

What kind of movies do you like? I would love to help. | User: Hi!  I'm hoping to find a movie that is thought-provoking or could spark a conversation after watching it.  Something like The Truman Show (1998) (what if you found out your whole life is a lie?) or Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind (2004) (would you choose to forget someone you had a bad relationship with?).  Both of those were great thoughto-provoking movies! | User: If you could suggest anything in a similar vein, that would be great! | Recommender: Thought provoking is always good! How about V for Vendetta  (2005) or The Black Dahlia  (2006) and also another one that is thought provoking is 12 Monkeys (1995)! | User: Oh, those are great suggestions!  I have seen V for Vendetta  (2005) and it was great!  I have not seen The Black Dahlia  (2006) or 12 Monkeys (1995), so I will definitely look for those! | Recommender: I would also recommend Psycho  (1960) you can never go wrong with a good psychological thriller to get a conversation started! I always want to understand why a person commits murder in a movie! I wonder what is going on in their mind. I want to know the characters background and how they grew up. | Recommender: Your welcome and I hope you have a great day! | User: Oh, that is also a great suggestion! | User: Thank you very much! | User: I hope you have a great day too!\nRecommender: Good evening | Recommender: What kind of movie(s) are you looking for? | User: Evening to you!
