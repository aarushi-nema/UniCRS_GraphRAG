Cool. | Recommender: You should also checkout Evangelion: 2.0 You Can  Advance . Not like ghost, but it's a good political drama | User: that's the new one right? | Recommender: Yeah. If you want to watch the original series, you should, but for a quick over view, watch Neon Genesis Evangelion: Death & Rebirth | Recommender: It explains the series very well | User: cool. thanks!\nUser: Hello? | Recommender: Still looking for anime? | User: lol, I am | Recommender: Umm.

I didn't know there was an anime. I'd heard of it, but assumed it was another expansion pack. | Recommender: No it's a movie. | Recommender: There's also Final Fantasy: The Spirits Within (2001) but it doesn't relate to any of the video games.

Like Akira  (1988) | Recommender: Well Vampire Hunter D: Bloodlust (2001) is what you want | Recommender: Or Appleseed  | User: What's Appleseed  ? | Recommender: It's about a soldier who gets made into a cyborg and how it affects his relationship with his partner. | User: interesting.
