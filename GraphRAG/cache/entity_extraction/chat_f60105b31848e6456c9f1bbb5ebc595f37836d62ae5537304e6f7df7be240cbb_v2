Have never heard of the second one. | Recommender: Robin Hood: Men in Tights (1993) is a great mix of genres if you dont mind musical sequences | User: Ferrel is just a comedy wizard. | Recommender: Who can beat A Night at the Roxbury (1998) ? | User: Wow, you read my mind! That was my fav growing up! | User: Both of those. Well, you have set me up just right. I will get onto watching these films pronto! | User: Thanks, good bye!\nUser: Hello there, how are you? | Recommender: hey! hope your day finds you well! | User: It has. Now, I hope it finds me some good movies! | Recommender: are you looking for any type of recommendation? maybe a specific genre? | User: I think I would like something a bit more serious, maybe even serious in space. | User: Like a scifi | Recommender: have you seen The Martian  (2015) ? that movie was pretty good | User: I have not. | User: I do like him. I liked him in Good Will Hunting (1997) | User: Matt Damon I mean. | Recommender: yeah me too! he was also good in the The Bourne Identity  (2002) | User: I have never saw those. | User: Do you like the franchise? | User: I always thought they were something like Mission: Impossible  | Recommender: i definitely do! but for a more updated movie i would have to recommend the Blade Runner 2049 (2017) movie! | User: I have heard very good things about that movie. | User: Is Harrison Ford in it much? | Recommender: its a good tribute role to play | User: I will check it out. | Recommender: but i think he should have been in it more if you ask me. lol | User: I think that will do it all for me. I have a good bit to dig into. Thank you, good bye!\nUser: Hi there, how is it going? | Recommender: Pretty good, bearing down during a snowstorm. How are you? | User: I am doing the same. | User: That said, some good movies would help a lot! | User: Do you know of any that will help with the indoors time from the snow? | Recommender: Well, what kind of genre were you thinking of? Family, horror, comedy, action? | User: I like just about anything. But am not a fan of horror so much. | User: Comedy would be best, keep it light in the lights out parts. | Recommender: What about Ace Ventura: Pet Detective (1994) ? | User: I have never saw it, but I love Jim Carrey. | User: What other ones of his would you say are great movies&gt; | Recommender: Central Intelligence (2016)  is a great movie, so is Ride Along  (2014) ! Great actors in both | User: I have seen neither. Who is the star? | Recommender: The Rock and Kevin Hart are in Central Intelligence (2016) , and Kevin Hart is in Ride Along  (2014) | User: I like Kevin Hart. | User: Do you know any good action movies then? | Recommender: The Matrix (1999) is a great, classic action movie with Keanu Reeves | User: I love that show. | User: Do you know anymore of his movies? | User: I think that has me about set then. Thank you o much, good bye!\nUser: Hello | Recommender: Hey! How are you? | User: I am looking to watch some good movies! | Recommender: Well, I'm pretty good with recommendations! What kind of genre are you feeling today? | User: How about a fantasy movie? | User: Or maybe sc-fi | Recommender: Pan's Labyrinth (2006) isn't very well known, and it's in a different language, but it's honestly a GREAT movie! Alien vs. Predator  (2004) is a good sci-fi movie too! | User: Is that the one with David bowie? | Recommender: I don't think so actually,Sigourney Weaver is though | User: Do you know any other good alien movies? | Recommender: The Prophecy (1995) is a good alien type movie, it's about campers that are being hunted by an alien bear type thing. Definitely not for children though. | User: Wow that seems really cool. | User: Got any more? | Recommender: Also, Arrival  (2016) is more of a realistic alien movie. It's hard to follow at first and may seem confusing, but it explains it all at the end. Worth looking at! | User: Wow that one seems cool too. | User: Do you have any newer ones in mind? maybe from 2016 and on? | User: I think that about cuts it for me. I have all I need to curl up and watch some good stuff. Thank you!\nUser: Hello there! | Recommender: Hi! How are you doing? | User: I am great. | User: I would be even better if I knew some good films to check out ! | Recommender: Well, let's see if I can help out!
