And the other movie with Nicole Kidman is that she wakes up blind but has no recollection of what is happening and she's trying to put the pieces together but a man is stopping her | User: Oh wow. That would suck. They both sound interesting. | Recommender: Both are really good movies.

Both funny with some drama in it, plus her sense of humor really makes the move. Have you seen It's Kind of a Funny Story  (2010) with Emma Roberts? That is another good movie! | User: No, I haven't. | Recommender: That one is about kids in a psychiatric ward but it's really funny. It also with the guy from the Hangover Zach Galifinakis | User: I liked him in The Hangover (2009) | Recommender: It so under-rated but such a good movie, it has the drama of Girl, Interrupted  (1999) with the humor of Juno (2007) , so it's really good | User: I really liked Juno (2007). | User: I also love Little Miss Sunshine (2006) | Recommender: That is such a good movie!! | Recommender: What about the movie The Edge of Seventeen (2016)  with Woody Hareson | User: I haven't seen that one | Recommender: I honestly thought it was going to be bad but it turned out to be such a funny movie!
