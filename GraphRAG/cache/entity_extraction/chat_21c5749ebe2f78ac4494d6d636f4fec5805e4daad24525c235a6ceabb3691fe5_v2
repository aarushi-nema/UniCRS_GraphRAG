Funny, romantic, and touching all at the same time. | User: i'll have to check it out | Recommender: The Princess Diaries  (2001) is also kind of in that same realm, and I think that's also a pretty funny movie | User: man i haven't seen that in years | User: i liked it tho | User: great suggesstions. | User: thank you! | User: have a good day! | Recommender: Oh and one more recent one that I forgot about for a second. The Duff (2015) . Very funny and sweet | Recommender: No problem at all! Hope I was of help, and you have a great day! | User: i never saw that actually | User: bye!\nUser: Hi there! | Recommender: hello! What are you looking for today&gt; | User: I'd love some good funny movie suggestions. I love movies like 21 Jump Street  (2012) | Recommender: that's a great one! I like Pitch Perfect (2012) a lot, but it has a heavy emphasis on music and Rebel Wilson is pretty annoying | User: Haha, yeah I have seen it! It was pretty good, but I agree some parts are a little odd. | Recommender: Deadpool  (2016) is fantastic if you like the character of Deadpool, but to be honest if you aren't a fan already it probably isn't worth watching | User: I have never really followed the comics, but I heard it was pretty funny! I might check it out! | Recommender: it has a lot of very raunchy humor. Ryan Reynolds is great in pretty much anything though | Recommender: Neighbors  (2014) is pretty funny, as long as you like Seth Rogan | User: Haha I've heard! I agree. I don't mind raunchy humor. I loved Forgetting Sarah Marshall (2008) | User: I haven't seen Neighbors  (2014) I'll have to check it out! Thank you for the suggestions! | Recommender: I love Russell Brand, he was the best part of that movie! Get Him to the Greek (2010) is worth watching just for the drug scene! | Recommender: you're welcome, have a wonderful day :) | User: Stroke the furry wall! | User: Haha, thanks! Goodbye!\nUser: Hey there! | Recommender: hello! | Recommender: what recommendations are you looking for? | User: I'd love some good action movie suggestions. Something like John Wick (2014) | Recommender: Taken  (2008) . One of my all time favorite films, certainly one of my all time favorite action movies. | Recommender: pretend there are no sequels because those are garbage, Taken is fantastic | User: That's a great movie! Haha I was just going to ask if you've seen the sequels! Good to know. | Recommender: I saw Taken 2 (2012) and hated it so much I couldn't bring myself to watch the third lol | Recommender: Crank  (2006) and Crank: High Voltage (2009) are very fast-paced, if deliberately stupid, action movies | User: Haha, it's like Saw  (2004) at this point, they need to stop making sequels! | User: Oh I've never seen those, I'll have to check them out! | User: Thank you for the suggestions. | Recommender: they're pretty great, you just have to turn your brain off while they're on | User: Have a good rest of your day! | Recommender: you too, take care :)\nRecommender: Hi there! | Recommender: What kind of movies are you looking for today? | User: Hello! | User: I want some fun crappy movies to watch. The Room  (2003) , Birdemic: Shock and Terror (2008) , that kind of thing | Recommender: Oh man! Have you seen The Gingerdead Man (2005) | Recommender: It's the best worst movie ever! | User: NO HAHAHA I love the title though! | User: that's definitely going on the list | Recommender: It has Gary Busey in it, it's awful gold. | User: oh my god it's about an actual gingerbread man | Recommender: Another one is Troll 2 (1990) | Recommender: Oh yeah, a gingerbread man that comes alive haha | User: sounds like ThanksKilling (2008) | Recommender: Haha I've never seen that, but I'm sure it is similar! | User: oh my god I'm trying to focus and I can't stop laughing at the plot to this gingerbread horror film | Recommender: Hahaha, yeah it's even better than you can imagine haha | User: thank yo so much for the suggestion, I'm gonna watch this today | User: IT HAS A SEQUEL WTF | Recommender: Haha no problem! HAHA | User: Gingerdead Man 2: Passion of the Crust (2008) | Recommender: Oh no. hahaha | Recommender: I hope you enjoy it! | User: haha thanks, have a great day! | Recommender: Have a good rest of your day!
