The villain was really good too. | User: I liked the story and it had more of his back story in it too. Do you like James Bond? | Recommender: That's a James Bond film I don't think I've seen it yet. | Recommender: I'm not a fan though. | User: It's good, but start with Casino Royale  (2006) if you haven't seen any of the newer ones. | Recommender: I am more into Jason Bourne  (2016) type of movies. | Recommender: Government secrecy and mind control programs. | User: Those are pretty good too. | Recommender: Is there other suggestion I can provide you with? | User: I think that is good. I'll have to watch that Leonardo Dicaprio one. I forgot about it. Thank you. Have a good night. | Recommender: Bye\nRecommender: Good evening! | User: Hello! | Recommender: Whats kind of movies do you like and what have you hated seeing? | User: Hated seeing... Let's see. | User: Let me tell you what I like first. | User: Because you asked that first.  :) | User: I like classic movies for sure. | User: And I like when they're remastered. | User: But classic cinema, even foreign, is a favorite of mine.  Especially if they're classic. | User: I mean, 'celebrated' classics | Recommender: well. here we go then! | User: So any Golden Era Hollywood flick. | Recommender: The Wizard of Oz  (1939) | User: Genre doesn't matter. | Recommender: Casablanca  (1942) | User: Gotta say I love The Wizard of Oz  (1939) | Recommender: and of course To Kill a Mockingbird  (1962)! | User: I just saw Casablanca  (1942) | User: And that last one was a milestone.  Boo Radley.  Scout. | User: Gregory Peck was a great actor. | Recommender: and course Titanic  (1997) is a classic!!!! | User: I'd agree that Titanic (2012)  was a worthy epic | User: I mean, the 1997 version | User: Kate and Leo | Recommender: what about It's a Wonderful Life (1946)? | User: I can recite lines from that one. | User: Zuzu's Petals. | User: Hey Bert!  My mouth is bleedin!  Whoopeeeee! | User: Jimmy Stewart was huge | User: Good suggestions.  I am going to go see what's on TCM | Recommender: aww! yes i love that one i watch it a lot at christmas time with my grandparents | Recommender: have a good night! | User: Goodbye!  :\nUser: Hello there | Recommender: Hi, how are you? | User: I am fine.  What about you? | Recommender: I am doing great, thanks. | Recommender: How can I help you with today? | User: Need to think about a good movie in something I'm not used to see.  Just to mix it up a bit | Recommender: Have you seen Zero Days (2016) ? | User: Zero Days?  Whats it about? | Recommender: Fascinating film about two tech employees in the Bay area who happened to discover a fatal malware created by the US government and Israeli to insert this virus into the computers of the Iranian government nuclear program and to dismantle it. However, it can operate on its own and do what it does. | User: Sounds like non-Fiction. | Recommender: Pretty much film goes on to say this malware or virus is out there and can shut down the entire continent power grid. | User: That's like something I would see.  Good suggestion.  Now I just have to find it on streaming. | Recommender: It is worth the watch. This malware is out of the box and is worst than a nuclear missile in my own opinion. | Recommender: I think Amazon should carry it. | User: I will give it a look. | Recommender: Another film is Hacksaw Ridge by Mel Gibson and it is worth the time and money. | User: I haven't seen that one either.  Award winning I think | Recommender: A great film to watch and be carried away from the busy life. | User: These are two good suggestions.  Zero Days (2016) sounds like the winner | Recommender: Another suggestion is The Darkest Hour  (2011) which is about Winston Churchill I just finished watching. Amazing is all I can say. | Recommender: I think the year is wrong it barely came out last year. | Recommender: Is there anything else I can help you with? | User: I have that movie.
