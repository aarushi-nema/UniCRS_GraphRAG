I am seriously curious. | Recommender: It's pretty good. Have you seen Collateral  (2004)? | User: I guess I could list a few others I have already seen, like Need for Speed  (2014)  and The Italian Job  (2003) | Recommender: it's about a cab driver and a hit man | User: I have seen Collateral  (2004) l, but it has been ages. | User: In fact, I barely remember it, I will watch that one again. | Recommender: It's a good one to rewatch! | Recommender: Hope those suggestions helped! | Recommender: bye | User: Take care!\nUser: Hello. | Recommender: Hello! Want to talk scary movies? | User: Yes!!! | Recommender: Lol, great! | User: lol | User: Love them! | Recommender: I just got done watching Alien  (1979), so I am in the mood for them. | Recommender: Of course, I am Home Alone (1990) at the moment. :) | Recommender: Know any good ones for a scare that isn't just a jump scare soundtrack? | User: I love Alien  (1979) ! | Recommender: I actually have a couple Alien toys on my desk. I am a fairly big fan. | User: I watched The Conjuring (2013) that was pretty scary. | Recommender: I still haven't seen that. I will have to give it a try. | User: Do you have any other suggestions for me? | Recommender: There is talk of a spin off from that series soon. The Crooked Man | User: Wow | Recommender: Well, do you like monsters or psychos? | User: What about psycho monsters? | Recommender: You can't go wrong with a classic like The Shining  (1980). Jack was pretty monstrous in it! | Recommender: Oh, I suppose It  (2017) would count as both too. | User: Exactly. I'd love to see it. | Recommender: I prefer the television version still, but mainly because I love Tim Curry. | User: I love The Shining  (1980) | Recommender: Of course, if you want a 'scary movie' that is good for a laugh, try Dracula 3000 (2004) . It is just silly bad lol | User: I haven't seen It  (2017) yet. Thank you so much for the suggestions. Goodbye. | Recommender: Take care | User: I haven't seen Dracula 3000 (2004)\nRecommender: Hello stranger! | User: Hello. | User: I'm looking to see a good action film like Baby Driver  (2017) | User: Do you recommend any? | Recommender: Know any good random movies like To Wong Foo, Thanks for Everything! Julie Newmar (1995) or The Birdcage (1996)? | Recommender: Ah, I still haven't seen that one yet. I heard the soundtrack is amazing. | User: It is and ties in well with the movie | Recommender: I suppose if you are looking for action movies with a light British feel and a good soundtrack, Kingsman: The Golden Circle | User: I have not seen the first two you have mentioned, but I liked The Birdcage (1996) | User: I still haven't seen Kingsman: The Golden Circle but I really liked Kingsman: The Secret Service (2014) | Recommender: Ah, the first one is just a long title. Has Wesley Snipers in drag lol | Recommender: Kingsman: The Secret Service (2014) is the superior movie, admittedly. However, both are worth watching. | User: Ah, haha | User: That is hilarious | User: i'm sure I'll enjoy it.  Thank you for the recommenation. | Recommender: It is actually a good movie. You should check it out when you are feeling vulnerable if that makes sense lol. | Recommender: A feel good movie, in the same manner as The Breakfast Club (1985) | User: That is a great one as well.  Thank you. | Recommender: No problem. Any last minute ideas for what I should watch tonight? | Recommender: I  will take anything, more random the better! | User: I'm not sure. I am watching Them! (1954) at the moment Haha | Recommender: Ha! I haven't watched that in awhile! I might just do that. Thanks. | User: You're welcome. Thank you for the suggestions.  Have a wonderful day. | Recommender: You take care now, you hear! | User: You too! | User: Goodbye\nRecommender: Hello! | User: Hello. | Recommender: What kind of movies are you looking for? | User: Horror movies please. Past or present is fine. | Recommender: One of my favorite older horror movies is Misery  (1990) . It's based on a Stephen King novel. | User: Love, love, love that movie and him. | Recommender: Same! Paranormal Activity (2007) freaked me out, but only the first one in the series. | User: I am too scared of that stuff to see it. | Recommender: Got it. Maybe Panic Room (2002) ? It's not that gory. | User: I just thought about that. I really liked it. | Recommender: And if you like Rob Zombie movies, you can watch House of 1000 Corpses (2003) or The Devil's\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>COLLATERAL (2004)<|>MOVIE<|>A 2004 thriller movie about a cab driver and a hitman)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>NEED FOR SPEED (2014)<|>MOVIE<|>A 2014 action movie titled Need for Speed)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>THE ITALIAN JOB (2003)<|>MOVIE<|>A 2003 heist movie titled The Italian Job)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ALIEN (1979)<|>MOVIE<|>A 1979 science fiction horror movie titled Alien)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>HOME ALONE (1990)<|>MOVIE<|>A 1990 comedy movie titled Home Alone)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>THE CONJURING (2013)<|>MOVIE<|>A 2013 horror movie titled The Conjuring)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>THE CROOKED MAN<|>MOVIE<|>A spin-off movie from The Conjuring series)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>THE SHINING (1980)<|>MOVIE<|>A 1980 psychological horror movie titled The Shining)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>IT (2017)<|>MOVIE<|>A 2017 supernatural horror movie titled It)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>DRACULA 3000 (2004)<|>MOVIE<|>A 2004 science fiction horror movie titled Dracula 3000)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>BABY DRIVER (2017)<|>MOVIE<|>A 2017 action movie titled Baby Driver)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>TO WONG FOO, THANKS FOR EVERYTHING!
