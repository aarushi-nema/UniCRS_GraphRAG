How about Monsters, Inc. (2001) thats a great kid friendly movie | User: I haven't seen that one, is it a series? | Recommender: there are two of them... Monsters University (2013) | User: great, I think those will work well | Recommender: they are both great films. Good for kids and has a few references that adults will appreciate | User: Thanks for all your help\nRecommender: Hello. How is your night going? | Recommender: Do you have anything in mind you would like to get suggestions for? | User: Hi I'm looking for a sports movie | Recommender: The first one that comes to mind is The Blind Side  (2009)  but I'm not sure if that is what you mean | Recommender: The Longest Yard  (2005)  came to mind as well but I don't think that is actually a sports movie. One second while I think of some others. | User: I have seen both of those, but I want something a bit more focused on the game. | Recommender: That's what I figured. I'm not sure if I have ever actually watched a movie focused on the game itself. Is Chariots of Fire (1981)  along the lines of what you're thinking of? | User: I' haven't seen it, but maybe | Recommender: I've never watched Blue Chips (1994)  but some actual NBA athletes play themselves in the movie so it might be something you would like. | User: I've seen it, the basketball is not a good as you would think. | User: The Greatest Game Ever Played (2005) was good | Recommender: I've heard of that but haven't watched. The only other movie I can come up with is The Natural  (1984) . I'm sorry I can't give better suggestions. I'm just not familiar with the subject. All I can think of are movies using sports as part of a larger plot. | User: that is a great suggestion, thanks for your help!\nUser: how are you? | Recommender: Hi I'm good. Are you looking for a movie? | User: I am | User: something i can watch with my girlfriend | User: maybe something to set the mood? | Recommender: The Notebook (2004) is always a good option | Recommender: Fifty Shades of Grey  (2015) is cheesy but it might work | User: LOL | User: it was wasnt it? | User: very little plot and kinda vanilla sex scenes for a movie about BDSM | User: like, who hasnt tied someone to a bed with a tie? | Recommender: very! how about Pride and Prejudice  | User: That could work. | User: I just watched Fifty Shades Freed  (2018) and it was HORRIBLE | User: literally the worst of them all. Surprised it could get any worse. My girlfreind agreed and she even liked the books! | Recommender: yikes! I tried the books but couldn't get passed 1 chapter. | Recommender: Me Before You  is sad up good | User: I didnt even try the books.
