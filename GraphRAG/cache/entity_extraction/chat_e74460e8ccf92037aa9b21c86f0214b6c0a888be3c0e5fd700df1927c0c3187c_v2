I'm excited for Black Panther (2018) myself | Recommender: Me too! I catch all of the Avengers movies. The last one we saw was Thor: Ragnarok (2017) at the cinema. | User: I fell in love with Marvel movies when I first saw Iron Man  (2008) | Recommender: That was my introduction to the films as well.

I hope you enjoy the upcoming movies, although there isn't much doubt they will be great.\nRecommender: Hello. | User: Hello, have you seen any good movies recently? | Recommender: Yes. | User: Do you have any suggestions?
