I'll have to check it out! | Recommender: No I have never seen The Princess Bride  (1987)  before. | Recommender: What is it about? | User: Oh ok. It's really good. A little of everything...comedy, action, romance. | User: A princess falls in love with a commoner and they pretty much fight the man she's supposed to marry so they can be together. It was a book turned into a movie | Recommender: Cool! I will have to check it out. | User: Well, I think I have a decent list of movies to see now. Thanks a lot for your recommendations! | Recommender: You're welcome. | Recommender: It was nice chatting goodbye. | User: Bye :)\nUser: Hi! I'm looking for some suggestions for good movies. What would you recommend? | Recommender: Hi, have you seen  The Sixth Sense (1999) ? | User: I enjoy pretty much any movie. But I really like suspenseful movies | User: I was actually just going to mention that. I love The Sixth Sense (1999) | User: The ending was ruined for me the first time I watched it but I still really enjoyed it | Recommender: It was a good movie I thought. | Recommender: Another good movie was Hell or High Water  (2016) | User: I've never seen that one. What's it about? | Recommender: Good action and great story. | Recommender: It has Jeff Bridges in it. | User: Sounds good! I enjoy most action movies too as long as there's no Tom Cruise in it | Recommender: What is a good movie you seen lately? | Recommender: LOL!  I am not a big Tom fan at all. | Recommender: I want to see Daddy's Home  (2015) | User: The only Tom Cruise I liked was Far and Away (1992) | Recommender: You would love to see Hell or High Water  (2016) , I really recommend this one. | User: The best movie I've seen recently in Concussion  (2015) with Will Smith. That was awesome | User: I'll have to check it out! | Recommender: I didn't like @Far and Away. | Recommender: I guess it would be Jerry Maguire (1996)  for me. | User: That actually used to be my favorite movie for a while. But I didn't like him in it all that much | Recommender: Nice chatting with you! | User: You too! Bye!\nRecommender: Hey! What kind of movies do you like to watch? | User: I'm really big on indie romance and dramas | Recommender: Ok what's your favorite movie? | Recommender: Staying with that genre, have you seen Juno (2007) or The Perks of Being a Wallflower  | Recommender: Those are two really good ones | User: When I was a kid I liked horror like Misery  (1990) | Recommender: @Misery is really creepy but really good. I only recently got into horror. Couldn't watch them when I was younger | User: But now I'm more along the lines of  The Martian  (2015) or just interesting content like that | User: I have a movie bud. She loves comedies like Bad Moms (2016) and is always trying to drag me to stuff like that. | User: What about you. What are your favorites? | Recommender: Oh no! I don't always mind comedies like that but I have to be in the mood. | Recommender: Neighbors  (2014) wasn't too bad | User: Yeah for sure. And I really don't want to see any more Kevin Hart movies! | Recommender: But I like all kinds of movies. I love The Princess Bride  (1987) , classics like On Golden Pond  (1981) | User: Yes! The Princess Bride  (1987) was one of my favorites too! | Recommender: But one of my favorites is Love and Basketball (2000) | Recommender: And if I'm going to watch horror, instead of the gore like Saw  (2004) I really prefer movies like Psycho  | User: Ok that's an older one right? | User: I also love lawyer movies like Philadelphia  (1993) | Recommender: Yea, the year wasn't added on the drop down list it was from 1960 I think | User: Ok gotcha. | Recommender: Yes, Philadelphia  (1993) was so good. Another good one is Erin Brockovich  (2000) . I don't think she was a lawyer though, maybe a paralegal. But it was one of my favorites for a while | Recommender: Hope I made some good suggestions! Nice chatting with you! | User: You too\nRecommender: Hello! | User: Hi! I am looking for a movie to watch. | Recommender: Have you seen Rushmore  (1998) ? | User: No, What is it about? | Recommender: It's about a young man's coming of age. Kind of a dark comedy. It's good. | User: What would you recommend for a romance film? | Recommender: Hmmmm | User: Something that's not too old. | Recommender: Maybe One Fine Day  (1996) | User: Oh yes, that one is good. | User: What is a good thriller? | Recommender: Not sure.  Do you have a recommendation? | User: I have always liked Signs  (2008)\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>THE PRINCESS BRIDE
