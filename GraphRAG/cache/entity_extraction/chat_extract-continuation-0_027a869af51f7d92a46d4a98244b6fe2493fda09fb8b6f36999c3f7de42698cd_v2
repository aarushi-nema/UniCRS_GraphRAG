Thanks for that, I need to watch that one ASAP, haha, I also love Kevin Hart! | User: Thanks a lot for the help. | User: Take care now. Bye! | Recommender: Have fun! | Recommender: And yes glad to help, take care also. | Recommender: Bye.\nRecommender: Hello, I'm Ashton. | User: Hi. I was wondering if you could recommend some movies. | User: I like romantic comedy and war movies. | Recommender: I saw Dunkirk  (2017) last year and greatly enjoyed it | User: My favorites are While You Were Sleeping  (1995) and We Were Soldiers (2002) | User: I saw Dunkirk, but it wasn't my favorite | Recommender: Do you know any good SciFi movies? | User: Independence Day  (2000) and Men in Black  (1997) | Recommender: Men in Black  (1997) is a funny one. I think about Blade Runner 2049 (2017) more than I expected. | User: I haven't seen Blade Runner (1982) | Recommender: I do not watch enough Romantic Comedies to recommend one. | User: Okay. I might try Blade Runner (1982)  if it is good | User: I also like The Patriot  (2000) | User: Mel Gibson does such a great job with war movies | Recommender: Agreed. I want to see Hacksaw Ridge made by him. | User: It is a great movie! | User: I bought it. | Recommender: I am apparently the recommender. Any other requests? | User: I think I will go and watch Blade Runner (1982) | User: Thanks! | User: Bye.\nRecommender: Hi. How are you? | Recommender: I heard you might be interested in a movie. What do you like? | User: Anything but romances | User: What movies do you know about most? | Recommender: How about We Were Soldiers (2002) | Recommender: What about We Were Soldiers (2002) | User: We were soldiers is good.

Let's see. | User: Have you seen Lost in Space  (1998) ? | Recommender: Sorry, Im looking at Netflix to see if I ca assist with finding you movies in that genre that I've enjoyed. | User: What do you like? | Recommender: Yes I have seen that movie, and I rather disliked it.

The first season is alright but the 3rd and 4th season I really enjoyed | Recommender: Each episode is different so there's variety in the show. It's definitely a show that makes you sit down and think for a while after watching. | Recommender: Hope you enjoy! :) | User: Thanks! | User: Did you\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>SAN ANDREAS (2015)<|>MOVIE<|>A 2015 disaster movie)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>PAIN & GAIN (2013)<|>MOVIE<|>A 2013 action-comedy movie)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CENTRAL INTELLIGENCE (2016)<|>MOVIE<|>A 2016 action-comedy movie)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>KEVIN HART<|>ACTOR<|>Actor known for comedic roles)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>DUNKIRK (2017)<|>MOVIE<|>A 2017 war movie)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>WHILE YOU WERE SLEEPING (1995)<|>MOVIE<|>A 1995 romantic comedy movie)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>WE WERE SOLDIERS (2002)<|>MOVIE<|>A 2002 war movie)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>INDEPENDENCE DAY (2000)<|>MOVIE<|>A 2000 sci-fi action movie)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>MEN IN BLACK (1997)<|>MOVIE<|>A 1997 sci-fi action comedy movie)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>BLADE RUNNER 2049 (2017)<|>MOVIE<|>A 2017 sci-fi movie)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>BLADE RUNNER (1982)<|>MOVIE<|>A 1982 sci-fi movie)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>THE PATRIOT (2000)<|>MOVIE<|>A 2000 war movie)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>HACKSAW RIDGE<|>MOVIE<|>A war movie directed by Mel Gibson)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ASHTON<|>DIRECTOR<|>Director of the recommendation system)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SPEED (1994)<|>MOVIE<|>A 1994 action movie)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SAFE HAVEN (2013)<|>MOVIE<|>A 2013 romantic thriller movie)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SPEED 2: CRUISE CONTROL (1997)<|>MOVIE<|>A 1997 action movie)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>WINDTALKERS (2002)<|>MOVIE<|>A 2002 war movie)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SAVING PRIVATE RYAN (1998)<|>MOVIE<|>A 1998 war movie)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>BLACK HAWK DOWN (2002)<|>MOVIE<|>A 2002 war movie)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>LOST IN SPACE (1998)<|>MOVIE<|>A 1998 sci-fi movie)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>THE HOST (2013)<|>MOVIE<|>A 2013 sci-fi movie)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>BLACK MIRROR<|>MOVIE<|>A TV show focusing on technology and society)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>KEVIN HART<|>CENTRAL INTELLIGENCE (2016)<|>Kevin Hart stars in Central Intelligence)<|>\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>DUNKIRK (2017)<|>WE WERE SOLDIERS (2002)<|>Both Dunkirk and We Were Soldiers are war movies)<|>\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>INDEPENDENCE DAY (2000)<|>MEN IN BLACK (1997)<|>Both Independence Day and Men in Black are sci-fi action movies)<|>\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>MEN IN BLACK (1997)<|>BLADE RUNNER 2049 (2017)<|>Both Men in Black and Blade Runner 2049 are sci-fi movies)<|>\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>BLADE RUNNER (1982)<|>BLADE RUNNER 2049 (2017)<|>Blade Runner (1982) is the original movie to Blade Runner 2049)<|>\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>THE PATRIOT (2000)<|>HACKSAW RIDGE<|>Both The Patriot and Hacksaw Ridge are war movies directed by Mel Gibson)<|>\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>WE WERE SOLDIERS (2002)<|>SAVING PRIVATE RYAN (1998)<|>Both We Were Soldiers and Saving Private Ryan are war movies)<|>\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>WE WERE SOLDIERS (2002)<|>BLACK HAWK DOWN (2002)<|>Both We Were Soldiers and Black Hawk Down are war movies)<|>\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>SPEED (1994)<|>SPEED 2: CRUISE CONTROL (1997)<|>Speed (1994) and its sequel Speed 2: Cruise Control (1997) are related movies)<|>\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>WE WERE SOLDIERS (2002)<|>WINDTALKERS (2002)<|>Both We Were Soldiers and Windtalkers are war movies)<|>\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>LOST IN SPACE (1998)<|>THE HOST (2013)<|>Both Lost in Space (1998) and The Host (2013) are sci-fi movies)<|>\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>BLACK MIRROR<|>THE HOST (2013)<|>Both Black Mirror and The Host (2013) are sci-fi related)<|>\n<|COMPLETE|>"}, {"content": "MANY entities and relationships were missed in the last extraction.
