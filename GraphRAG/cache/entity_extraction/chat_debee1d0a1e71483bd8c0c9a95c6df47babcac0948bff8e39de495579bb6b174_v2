I think that's a great suggestion and I'll go with that one! | User: Thanks very much! | User: Bye. | Recommender: Jennifer lopez is in The Back-up Plan\nRecommender: Hello. | Recommender: How is your weekend going? Is there anything in particular you are looking for? | User: Hi, it is going good. How about yours? | Recommender: Good. I would be happy with less snow though, as in none. It does make for good move watching weather. | User: e some action movie recommendations please. I saw The Hitman's Bodyguard and liked it a lot. | Recommender: Oh. I saw that. Let me think for a minute. | User: That is true. I don't get snow, since I live in Florida. | Recommender: Well aren't you lucky. I wish I did. Have you ever seen American Ultra (2015) ? | User: No, I haven't, but I will check it out, because I did see American Assassin  and liked that. | Recommender: Hitman: Agent 47 (2015)  was pretty good too. I'm glad you mentioned you already saw the other one since I was going to suggest it next. | Recommender: Logan Lucky (2017)  is along similar lines but it was a bit confusing. | User: This one sounds good too. | User: I'll pass on that one then, lol. | Recommender: Awesome. I hope some of those suggestions work for you. The only other one I can think of is The Foreigner  (2016) with Jackie Chan. I liked it a lot. | User: I saw this and it was good. Did you see American Assassin? | Recommender: Not the whole movie. My husband was watching it and I saw bits and pieces as I was playing on the computer. I didn't give it my full attention so I probably missed things. | User: Oh, okay. We'll thank you much for your help. I will check out the movies you suggested. | User: Good bye. | Recommender: Bye.\nRecommender: Hello, what kind of movie are you interested in? | User: Hi.  I like horror movies. | Recommender: Saw  (2004) | User: But I prefer to watch them at home instead of at the theaters. | User: Saw was good.  I seen it when it first came out. | Recommender: Did you see the most recent one, Jigsaw (2017) | User: I've also seen The Shining  (1980) and Mother! (2017) recently in the theaters. | User: I haven't seen it. | Recommender: Did you see the new It  (2017)? | User: Can you tell me a little bit about Jigsaw? | Recommender: IMDB would be better to tell you about that: | Recommender: https://www.imdb.com/title/tt3348730/reference | User: Okay I will check that out. | Recommender: Any other particular horror movie sub-genres you like? | User: I appreciate your help.  Thank you so very much. | User: Goodbye | Recommender: There's another movie I should mention to you! | User: Okay...I'm always open to one more. | Recommender: Split (2017)? | Recommender: with James McAvoy? I think it might be 2016, not 2017. | User: Yes, that is great.  Thank you.\nUser: Hello. | Recommender: Hello. | Recommender: How is your weekend going? Is there a specific type of movie you are looking for? | User: It's going good.  Thank you.  Yes, I was thinking about a horror or scary movie, do you know of any? | Recommender: I love horror movies. Have you seen Insidious: Chapter 4 (2018) ? | User: No, is it good? | Recommender: It kind of stretches the plot but it is still good. | Recommender: I recently watched It  (2017)  which was great, of course. | Recommender: Let the Right One In  (2008)  is a good psychological thriller with some vampires. | User: I haven't seen that either, they both sound good.  I love psychological thrillers. | Recommender: Did you watch the Poltergeist  (1982)  movies? They are older but classics. | User: In fact, I like those even more than horror.  I loved The Silence of the Lambs  (1991) ! | Recommender: That was a really good movie too. | User: Yes, I saw Poltergeist  (1982) -- it was good, they came out with a remake in Poltergeist  (2015). | Recommender: I remember that. They did a good job with the remake I think. You might want to watch The Conjuring 2 (2016)  if you haven't seen it yet. It is a legit scary horror movie | Recommender: I hope some of those suggestions work out for you. | User: OK, I will check them out, thank you and hope you have a good night. | Recommender: You too. | User: Bye\nUser: Hello. | Recommender: Hi, how are you this afternoon? | User: Good and you? | Recommender: I'm good.  I'm here to help you with a movie if you're interested. | User: I need some suggestions on Bollywood movies. | Recommender: Okay great.
