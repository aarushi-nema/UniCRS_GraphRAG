I'm thinking something like 13 Going on 30 (2004) or Confessions of a Shopaholic  (2009). | Recommender: Hi!  This is my first time doing this one.  I think a light comedy that you may like is The Devil Wears Prada  (2006).  It's cute and funny! | User: I've seen The Devil Wears Prada  (2006), and loved it!  You're right that it's cute and funny. | Recommender: Also another one you may like is any of the Pitch Perfect (2012).  I haven't seen the most recent one but heard its a good one too! | Recommender: I just saw (for the 2nd time) The Greatest Showman (2017) .  It's not really a comedy but it's really good.  I highly recommend it. | User: I haven't seen Pitch Perfect (2012) yet, so I will look for that one!
