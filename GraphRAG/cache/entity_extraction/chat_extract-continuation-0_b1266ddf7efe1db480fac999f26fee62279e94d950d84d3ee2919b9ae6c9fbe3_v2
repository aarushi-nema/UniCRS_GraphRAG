(1980) is very funny as well. | User: I have not seen either. Can you fill me in a little on each? | Recommender: Anchorman: The Legend of Ron Burgundy (2004) is about a guy who works at a news network. Suddenly women start working there as anchors and shennanigans ensue. | Recommender: Airplane! (1980) is about a flight that ends up food poisoned, and one of the passengers has to land the plane. | User: Those both sound very funny! | Recommender: If you like raunchy comedy Ted  (2012) is pretty good.

I've seen Charlie and the Chocolate Factory  (2005), It wasn't my cup of tea. | Recommender: Have you seen Agent Cody Banks (2003) ? | Recommender: It's similar to spy kids in that it is about spies, but it's a little different. Still a silly and fun movie. | User: I haven't. Who is in it? | Recommender: It stars Frankie Muniz and Hilary Duff. A childhood favorite movie! | User: That sounds good! | Recommender: I'm sure you'll like it- I hope I was of some assistance! | User: You were, thanks. | User: Bye.\nRecommender: Hi, You're looking for movies? | User: Hey there, yeah I am.

I love cowboy type movies | Recommender: The Artist  (2011) is set in the 20's. | User: The Artist  (2011) looks like exactly what I'm looking for! | Recommender: I'm glad! | User: Thanks a lot, I can't wait to watch that movie | Recommender: No problem. | Recommender: I hope you have a great night. | User: You too!

That's a great one. It's about a new coach joining the US Mens hockey team. | User: I haven't seen that one. I really like hockey so I am sure it will be good. | Recommender: Another great one is Slap Shot  (1977) , also a hockey movie. It is more of a drama, with some humorous bits. | User: Great I didn't know there was so many hockey movies. | Recommender: Yes there are quite a few!
