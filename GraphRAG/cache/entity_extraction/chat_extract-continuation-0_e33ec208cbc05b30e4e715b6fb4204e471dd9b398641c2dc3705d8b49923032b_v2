I have a good bit to dig into. Thank you, good bye!\nUser: Hi there, how is it going? | Recommender: Pretty good, bearing down during a snowstorm. How are you? | User: I am doing the same. | User: That said, some good movies would help a lot! | User: Do you know of any that will help with the indoors time from the snow? | Recommender: Well, what kind of genre were you thinking of? Family, horror, comedy, action? | User: I like just about anything. But am not a fan of horror so much. | User: Comedy would be best, keep it light in the lights out parts. | Recommender: What about Ace Ventura: Pet Detective (1994) ? | User: I have never saw it, but I love Jim Carrey. | User: What other ones of his would you say are great movies&gt; | Recommender: Central Intelligence (2016)  is a great movie, so is Ride Along  (2014) ! Great actors in both | User: I have seen neither. Who is the star? | Recommender: The Rock and Kevin Hart are in Central Intelligence (2016) , and Kevin Hart is in Ride Along  (2014) | User: I like Kevin Hart. | User: Do you know any good action movies then? | Recommender: The Matrix (1999) is a great, classic action movie with Keanu Reeves | User: I love that show. | User: Do you know anymore of his movies? | User: I think that has me about set then.

Definitely not for children though. | User: Wow that seems really cool. | User: Got any more? | Recommender: Also, Arrival  (2016) is more of a realistic alien movie. It's hard to follow at first and may seem confusing, but it explains it all at the end. Worth looking at! | User: Wow that one seems cool too. | User: Do you have any newer ones in mind? maybe from 2016 and on? | User: I think that about cuts it for me.
