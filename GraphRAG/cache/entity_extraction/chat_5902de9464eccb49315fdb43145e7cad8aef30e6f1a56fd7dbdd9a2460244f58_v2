Is there any particular interest you have in a Disney movie so that I can pair you with one best fit for you? | User: I like to sing along | User: so good music is a must | Recommender: Great! I know many people enjoy Mulan (1998) as a classic disney film which features many song tracks to sing along to! | User: I did see that one, but it's been a long time. | User: And I remember the music was good. | User: Let's keep thinking, but keep that as a maybe. | Recommender: It has been a while since it's original release.
