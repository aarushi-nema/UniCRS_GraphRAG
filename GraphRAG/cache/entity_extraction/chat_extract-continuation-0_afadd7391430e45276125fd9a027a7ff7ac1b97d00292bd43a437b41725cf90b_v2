I'm interested in finding a body swap type of movie.  Something similar to Freaky Friday  (2003) .  Can you think of anything? | Recommender: There is a movie called The Change-Up (2011) where two guys somehow switch bodies | User: I've never heard of that one.  Sounds interesting! | User: It could also be a movie where a person swaps roles but not bodies, like The Parent Trap  (1998) | Recommender: Or The Hot Chick (2002) , sort of a funny version of how body swapping can go horribly wrong. | User: Right!  That movie is crazy. | User: I haven't seen it in awhile, either. | Recommender: I thought that it was hilarious. | User: Of course, there is Big  (1988) .  We saw that one recently, though. | Recommender: Otherwise too White Chicks (2004) might be something along those lines as well. | Recommender: Oh that is a good movie too. | User: Yes, White Chicks (2004)  is a great suggestion!
