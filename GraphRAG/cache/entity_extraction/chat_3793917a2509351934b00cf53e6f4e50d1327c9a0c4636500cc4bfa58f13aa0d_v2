Not a good movie at all... | Recommender: What about Annabelle: Creation (2017) ? That was really good. | Recommender: Or It Comes at Night (2017) , that was really creepy. | User: I did not get to see that one!  I think that is a great suggestion | User: It Comes at Night (2017) was awful! Nothing actually ever came. LOL | Recommender: I haven't seen Mother! (2017) , I have heard it is okay. | Recommender: I need to go now, you have a great day! | User: But, I will definitely take your other suggestion into consideration.  Mother! (2017) was one of the worst movies..lol | User: Thanks! | User: Bye\nRecommender: Hi! | Recommender: I hear you are looking for movies! | User: Hi! I'm looking for movies that star Cameron Diaz! | User: I thought There's Something About Mary (1998) was really funny! | Recommender: Okay, have you seen The Other Woman  (2014) | User: I have not. Is it funny or drama? | User: I like all sorts of movies. | Recommender: Or The Sweetest Thing (2002) ?  That one was hilarious. | User: Oh! I forgot about that movie. It is so hilarious is one of my favorites that she has done. | Recommender: That one is a comedy about a guy cheating on her with other women and they get together and mess his life up. lol | User: Sometimes I forget about the oldies. | Recommender: It happens...lol | User: Oh, that sounds hilarious and I vaguely remember seeing a trailer for it. | User: Can you help me think of another one. I'm making a list. | Recommender: Can't go wrong with Shrek (2001), if voice over work counts.. | User: Oh. I forgot about Shrek (2001) as well. LI like her as Princess Fiona. | Recommender: My Best Friend's Wedding (1997) is another great one | User: Thanks so much for jogging my memory of old movies and suggesting some new movies. | Recommender: Excellent!

We loved Neighbors  (2014)  and I think they are pretty similar. | Recommender: I think so too but I haven't seen Neighbors  (2014) so I'm not certain. | User: Thanks for your suggestions. I need to go now. Have a great day.\nRecommender: Hi there! | User: Hello. | Recommender: Are you looking for a specific typo of movie? | User: I am looking for a comedy.
