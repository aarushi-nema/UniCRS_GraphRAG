I am not a star-wars fan unfortunately. | Recommender: Hmm.. I have never heard of the The Postman  (1997). Thats okay. But Star Wars: Episode VIII – The Last Jedi (2017) was just a remake to make money. Have you seen The Hunger Games  (2012) ? | Recommender: What about The Book of Eli (2010) ? | User: I agree. Star Wars: Episode VIII – The Last Jedi (2017) was nothing but a money gimmick.  I didn't care for The Hunger Games  (2012)  but I loved The Book of Eli (2010) .
