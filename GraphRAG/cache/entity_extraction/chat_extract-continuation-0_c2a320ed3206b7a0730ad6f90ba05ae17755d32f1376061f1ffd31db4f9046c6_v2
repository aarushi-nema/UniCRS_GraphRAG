Enjoy your movie :) | User: My favorite movie from when I was young was Annie  (1982) | User: Hope you have a great weekend.\nUser: Hello. I hope your enjoying your Saturday. I'm looking for some good movies to watch this evening. | Recommender: hi, how are you? | User: I am doing very well, thank you. | Recommender: Good, what type of movies do you like? | User: I like movies in the science fiction or fantasy genres but I also enjoy movies with a bit of a dark themed humor such as Seven Psychopaths (2012) | Recommender: ok, I recommend watching Equilibrium  (2002) | User: That is a new one for me. Thank you. I'll check it out. | Recommender: Some more are Snowpiercer (2013) , Total Recall  (2012) , Halo  (1996) , and The Perfect Host (2010) | User: Awesome. I've heard of some of those but the only one I've seen is Total Recall  (2012) . I liked it so I will probably like the rest as well. | Recommender: They are really good movies, I highly recommend them. | User: Thank you very much. I appreciate the help. The Perfect Host (2010) reminds me a bit of Children of Men (2006) so I'll check it out first. | User: Have a great weekend.\nRecommender: good day! | User: Hey I'm really into romance movies any good suggestions? Thanks! | Recommender: Hmm. let me think for a sec. Have you seen The Big Sick (2017) ? It's romantic and funny | User: I like movies like Beauty and the Beast  (2017) and A Walk to Remember (2002) oh and lol I have never seen the The Big Sick (2017) | User: Or Never Been Kissed (1999)  and Romeo and Juliet  (2007) | Recommender: I highly recommend! great story! Have you seen The Notebook (2013) ? That's a big one amongst romance fans | User: I love the The Notebook (2013) a really great film. | Recommender: and if you liked Romeo and Juliet  (2007) then I have to reccommend Titanic  (1997) for Leo. | Recommender: Also a recent sweet romantic comedy was The Duff (2015) | User: Ahh the great Titanic  (1997) what a classic thanks for recommending that one. | User: I will definitely have to check out the The Duff (2015) thanks so much for your help! | Recommender: No problem!

Have you seen the new Jumanji  (2017)  that is in theaters? | User: That was a good movie. I like Spider-Man: Homecoming (2017) | Recommender: I haven't yet but if you like Jumanji  (2017) you might also like another movie that blends humor, creatures, and action. Snakes on a Plane (2006) | Recommender: Another fun creature flick is Gremlins (1984). It's from the 80's so there's a good bunch of people who don't know about that one | User: I seen it and it was ok.  Do you like Action movies like The Long Kiss Goodnight (1996) | User: Yes that is an oldie but good. | User: What genre do you like? | Recommender: Actions are good depending on the Director! I think my favorite one was Crank  (2006).
