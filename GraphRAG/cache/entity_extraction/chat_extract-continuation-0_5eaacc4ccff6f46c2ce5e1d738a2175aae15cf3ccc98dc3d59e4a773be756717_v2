Similar titles would be nice | Recommender: Or there's also The Shining  (1980) or It (1990) | User: I've never seen the original The Shining  (1980) . So many told me it was boring. Is it? | User: Have you seen it? | Recommender: I have. I would agree if you are use to today's horror films it may seem boring | User: No, I prefer the older films. They have better stories. Horrors today seem like they're pieced together for cheap thrills and jump scares. | User: I liked the original Psycho  (1960) | User: What about older ghost stories? know any? | Recommender: There's The Amityville Horror  (1979) which I guess you could consider a ghost story | User: Didn't think about that one. I will give it a try and see how I like it. :)\nRecommender: Hi how can I help you find a movie | User: Yes please could you find me a comedy similar to Pitch Perfect (2012) or Pitch Perfect 2 (2015) | Recommender: Just a musical Comedy or a female led comedy | Recommender: something like Into the Woods  (2014) or The Heat  (2013) | User: Who is in The Heat  (2013) ? | Recommender: Sandra Bolluck | Recommender: and Melissa Mcarthy | Recommender: They are really funny together | Recommender: I would highly recommend | Recommender: checking it out if you havne't seen it yet | User: Okay that sounds good | User: I'll check it out | Recommender: Enjoy it | User: Thank you! | Recommender: You're welcome\nUser: Hi! | Recommender: Hi there.

It's animated but the story hits home in a lot of ways. | Recommender: Then there's Collateral Beauty (2016) with Will Smith and Helen Mirren. | Recommender: Also, though it's not a &quot;tear jerer&quot; per se, the ending did make me cry a bit. Odd Thomas  (2013) with Anton Yelnich. I guess it's even more so difficult to watch knowing he's passed since then. | User: Maybe something more along the lines of I Am Sam (2001) or Forrest Gump (1994) | Recommender: Hmm.... let me see..... | Recommender: Hae you ever seen Dancer in the Dark (2000) ? | Recommender: It's about an almost-blind Czech immigrant whose only way of escaping the horrors of a murder trial are by starring in her own musicals. | User: No I havent | Recommender: Gets me everytime. | User: I'll check it out | User: Thank you\nRecommender: Hello! | User: Hi im looking for a bad movie | User: like a really bad one | User: I wanna laugh at how bad it is | User: like Birdemic: Shock and Terror (2008) | Recommender: Have you seen Sharknado ? | User: I loved that one | Recommender: That's My Boy  (2012) was pretty awful | User: I loved that one | User: it was pretty bad | Recommender: or Bucky Larson: Born to Be a Star (2011) | User: but so funny | User: I haven't seen that one yet | User: is that another adam sandler one? | Recommender: He is in it yes, but Nick Swardson plays the main character | User: Fun | User: I'll have to check it out | User: thanks | Recommender: Enjoy!\nUser: Hi there! | User: Can you recommend a few good tear jerkers? | Recommender: Hope so.

My wife loves it! | Recommender: Okay, what about Collateral Beauty (2016)  with Will Smith? | User: No I haven't seen that. Isn't it about death? | Recommender: Sort of.
