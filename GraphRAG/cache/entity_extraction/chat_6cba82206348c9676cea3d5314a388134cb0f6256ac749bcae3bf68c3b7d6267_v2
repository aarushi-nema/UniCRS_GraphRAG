I'm looking for a good movie to watch this morning. Can you help? | Recommender: Sure thing! Might I suggest some early morning drama? The Family Stone (2005) and Sleepless in Seattle (1993) are two of my favorites. | User: I've seen theose already unfortunately. Recommend anything similar to Unfaithful  (2002) with Richard Gere? | Recommender: What about When the Bough Breaks  (2016) with Morris Chestnut? It's pretty good. Reminds me of an urban The Hand That Rocks the Cradle  | User: That sounds like it might be good then! | User: Is it on DVD? | Recommender: It is. | Recommender: You might also like Obsessed  (2009) with Beyonce. It similar but without the fatal attraction nanny/surrogate. | User: Ah okay, lol | User: And one last thing. How about a comdey? | Recommender: Perhaps The Nutty Professor  (1996) will suffice? | User: The one with Eddie Murphy? | Recommender: Yes. | User: I've seen it, but I don't think the wife has. So I'll rent it too. Thanks man! | Recommender: no problem. enjoy!\nUser: hey there! can you recommend some good Godzilla movies? | Recommender: Sure can!

It's a pretty cool fight sequence at the end. | Recommender: Yeah, he looks like regular Godzilla only he has these two huge crystal like objects protruding from his back. It's a pretty cool fight sequence at the end. | User: Oh okay. I might check that out simply because the concept sounds intriguing. :) | Recommender: Also, there's a newer version of mechaGodzilla in Godzilla Against Mechagodzilla (2002) . It's a japanese release, but great! | User: Oh okay. Does it involve space aliens like the older movies? | Recommender: No, this mechaGodzilla is built by the government using a dead Godzilla's bones. | Recommender: There's also a sequel, Godzilla: Tokyo S.O.S. (2003) | User: Awesome! I'm getting excited already. | Recommender: lol, | Recommender: There's also a new Japanese release called Shin Godzilla (2016) . I'm not too sure about the storyline, but I think its one where a godzilla dies then gets reborn. I havent seen this one yet, but hear it's pretty good. | User: I'll check it out. Thanks for the suggestions though! | Recommender: Anytime!\nUser: Hi there. Can you recommend some good movies.

Have you seen The Perfect Guy  (2015) ? | User: No, what's that about? | Recommender: It's a typical stalker/fatal attraction movie. Kind of like Obsessed  (2009) starring Beyonce and Morris Chestnut, but instead this time, a woman is being stalked. | Recommender: Another good choice is No Good Deed  (2014) with Idris Elba. It's like the other two as well. | User: Oh okay. Wow. I havent seen any of these. | Recommender: I've only seen Obsessed  (200\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}], "parameters": {"model": "gpt-3.5-turbo", "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "temperature": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0}}}
