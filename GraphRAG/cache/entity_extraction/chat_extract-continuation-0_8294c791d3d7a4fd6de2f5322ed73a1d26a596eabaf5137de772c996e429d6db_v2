I'll have to check them out!  Thanks! | Recommender: I laughed hard for Daddy's Home  (2015) it was goofy funny. | Recommender: Yes, you might like those then. | Recommender: Glad I could help and have a great movie day! | User: Me, too.  The motorcycle part was hysterical.  Thanks so much!  Have a great day!\nRecommender: Hello there! | User: Hello | Recommender: How can I help you? | User: I'm looking for an action movie. I liked Mad Max (1979) | Recommender: Great movie! | User: I liked Mad Max: Fury Road (2015) too | Recommender: Have you seen Mad Max: Fury Road (2015)? Such a good one | User: Yes, it's great! | Recommender: Yes! | User: I'm looking for any type of action movie | Recommender: The Fast and the Furious have a little of those elements just without it being a distopian world. | User: I love The Fast and the Furious! | User: I saw XXX  (2016) but didn't like it as much as The Fast and the Furious . | Recommender: I just watched Baby Driver  (2017) it is by the writer of Scott Pilgrim vs. the World (2010). It is very unique and very fun to watch. | User: I'll look into it! Sounds like a movie I'd like. | User: Thanks for the suggestions. | Recommender: I think it might! Have a great movie day! | User: Goodbye!\nRecommender: Hey! | Recommender: What can I help you with today? | User: Can you recommend any 1980's movies? | User: I especially like comedies. | Recommender: Great decade for those movies! | Recommender: What about Airplane! (1980) and The Caddy (1953). Both have sequels too! | Recommender: The Blues Brothers  (1980) and Private Benjamin  (1980) are cult classics too! | User: I've heard of them but never watched either one.  I have heard that Airplane! (1980)  is really funny.  I will have to check it out. | Recommender: It is super funny, you won't regret that one! | Recommender: I hope I helped. | Recommender: Have a great movie day! | User: I haven't seen either of those.  Thanks for all your help! | User: Bye!\nRecommender: hi what kind of movie do you want to see ? | User: Hi. I want to see an action film | Recommender: Funny like 21 Jump Street  (2012) or serious like John Wick (2014) ? | User: Interesting. I would suggest  a funny one like 21 Jump Street  (2012) | Recommender: I would recommend Beverly Hills Cop (1984) and Pineapple Express  (2008) | Recommender: and Hot Fuzz (2007) | User: I like to be able to laugh when watching a film but also be entertained by the action. Beverly Hills Cop (1984) sounds like buddy cop movie which is similar to the genre | User: What can you say about Pineapple Express  (2008) ? | Recommender: if you like buddy cop movies, then there is Lethal Weapon (1987) | Recommender: Pineapple Express  (2008) is a comedy with a faire share of action, but no stunts like Beverly Hills Cop (1984) | User: I like the fact that these films are from a different era. I also love a bit of nostalgia. It sounds like Pineapple Express  (2008) may not have enough action for my liking | Recommender: Beverly Hills Cop II (1987) had a car chase with a semi truck quite spectacular | User: Wow! Would love to see how they pulled that off. Any stars in it? | Recommender: there is Eddi Mruphy and Judge Reinhold | User: Sounds exciting. Would you say it's family friendly? | Recommender: They are action film with cops, you will have gun and drugs | Recommender: except Hot Fuzz (2007) , this one only has guns | User: It doesn't sound too bad. As long as there is an adult in the room anyway. | Recommender: There is no excessive violence like RoboCop (1987) | Recommender: This one is not family friendly | User: I did like RoboCop (1987) but did think it was quite violent | User: It's good to hear that these ones are less so | User: These suggestions have been so helpful. I definitely appreciate your recommendations | Recommender: have a nice evening | User: You too. Thanks\nUser: Hi! | Recommender: Hey! What's one of your favorite movies? | User: I'm looking for movies similar to The Nutty Professor (1963) | Recommender: Oh that is such a good one! | Recommender: Have you seen Tommy Boy (1995) ? | User: Nope, I haven't seen that. | Recommender: it's one of my favorites.
