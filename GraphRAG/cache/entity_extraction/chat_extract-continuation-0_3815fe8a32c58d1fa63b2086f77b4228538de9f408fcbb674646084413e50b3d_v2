It's been a snowy weekend here. Perfect for a good movie! | Recommender: Sure. I love comedies!  One of my favorites is Bridesmaids  (2011) . Have you watched it? | User: YES! its hilarious | Recommender: Yes it definitely is. I love Melissa Mccarthy. Another of my favorites is Trainwreck  (2015) . | User: I havent seen that one I think | User: I liked Father Figures (2017)  with Owen Wilson | Recommender: Amy Schumer stars in Trainwreck  (2015) . I admit I thought it would be mediocre but it turned out to be really good. | Recommender: I haven't heard of Father Figures (2017) . | Recommender: Owen Wilson has been in so many great comedies like Wedding Crashers (2005) , The Internship (2013) , and Meet the Parents (2000) . Can't go wrong with one of his flicks. | User: Deadpool  (2016)  was another good one but not ness a comedy enough I lasughted my butt off | Recommender: I am not familiar with that one. | User: Its a marvel movie. But thank you for your suggestions.\nUser: Hi I am looking for a movie I can enjoy with my 12 year old daughter. | Recommender: Hello! What types of movies does your 12 year old daughter enjoy? | User: Romantic movies or ones with heroines. | Recommender: What is a movie that you have enjoyed in the past? | User: I really enjoyed Anne of Green Gables  (1985) and she did too. | Recommender: Have you two watched Pride and Prejudice  ? | User: I have not seen it? That is a good suggestion. | User: Are there any more modern story movies you think I would enjoy? | Recommender: The more recent Jane Eyre  (2011) is another one I think you and your daughter would enjoy | User: That sounds like a good one too. She really liked Romeo and Juliet  (2007) so she will probably enjoy that. | User: Thanks for the suggestions! Have a nice day | Recommender: You are more than welcome! Enjoy!\nUser: Hello! | Recommender: hello | Recommender: What kind of movies do you like? | User: Can you recommend some funny movies? I don't care when they were made. | Recommender: Daddy's Home  (2015) was really funny. Have you seen it? | User: I haven't. I like other Will Ferrel movies though, like The Candidate  (2008) or Step Brothers  (2008) | User: Do you know anything else he was in that you can suggest? | Recommender: Yes, he is really funny! Anchorman: The Legend of Ron Burgundy (2004) is one of his movies that a lot of people like. | User: Oh yeah, I loved that one. I know he is in a whole bunch. I know I haven't seen one where he is like in college or something like that. Do you know which one that is? | Recommender: Will Ferrell is very funny! I think that one was Old School  (2003). It's silly too! Seen it? | User: That is the one! I haven't. I should watch that one. Thanks for the suggestion. | Recommender: Sure! Step Brothers  (2008) was truly hilarious! Great pick! | Recommender: Well happy movie watching! | User: Thanks!\nUser: Hi! I'm looking for an action filled movie similar to Jurassic Park  (1993) | Recommender: Ok, have you seen Jurassic World (2015)? | User: Yes I loved that movie as well. | User: Are there any good movies without dinosaurs? | Recommender: Have you seen King Kong  (2005) ? | User: Yes! That was another great giant monster movie :) | Recommender: What about Jaws  (1975) &amp; Jaws 2 (1978) ? Oldies but goodies | Recommender: Scary action? Suspense gives me the rumblies | User: I absolutely loved the first one. One of my favorite movies ever :) Honestly I can't say I remember much about the second one. Jaws 3-D (1983) was quite funny and Jaws: The Revenge (1987) was just weird. | User: I do love suspense too... | Recommender: I like suspense but sometimes I can barely handle it! | Recommender: It gives me anxiety! LOL | User: That's understandable. As long as it's not too gory I don't generally have a problem with those things. | Recommender: Well, it was great chatting with you! Have a great one! | User: You too! Thanks!\nUser: Hello | Recommender: Hi! How was your day? What sort of movie are you interested in tonight? | User: My day has been going pretty well. I am into horror movies like The Exorcist  (1973) and Halloween  (1978) | User: What about you? | Recommender: Those are great movies! What about Friday the 13th  (1980) or A Nightmare on Elm Street (1984)? | Recommender: My day has been great! | Recommender: It Follows (2014) is a good fairly recent horror film as well.
