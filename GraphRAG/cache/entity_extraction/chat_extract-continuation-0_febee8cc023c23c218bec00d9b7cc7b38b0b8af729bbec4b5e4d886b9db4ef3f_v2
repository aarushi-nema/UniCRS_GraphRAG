My 7 year old really enjoyed it and wasn't scared in the least bit. Another one your little one may enjoy is Warcraft  (2016)! It's based off of the game World of Warcraft that's really popular. | User: Great suggestions. | User: Thanks so much for your help. | User: Have a good day! | Recommender: Thank you, you were a pleasure to talk to. You too!\nRecommender: Hi, how are you? | User: super awesome | User: but...im having a dilemma | User: i need to occupy some time and was wondering if you had any movie suggestions i might be able to appreciate | Recommender: I'm sure I have some that you'd enjoy! What type of movies do you like? | User: im really not super picky, but if you know of any newer sci-fi movies i think that would be awesome | Recommender: Hm, that's a good question. Aliens vs. Predator: Requiem (2007) isn't super new, but it's still really good. | Recommender: Jurassic World (2015) is another great one | User: you know...i really havent had a chance to see that one. i should definitely check it out | User: and the Jurassic movies are all pretty entertaining as well | Recommender: I think so too. Have you seen The Martian  (2015)? It's not so much a sci fi movie, but it's VERY good. | User: Matt Damon is a pretty good actor. I liked that one too! | User: any other types of movies that you could suggest? your choice...what would you reccommend the most right now | Recommender: Edge of Tomorrow (2014) is good. Also, my number one recommendation is Bad Moms (2016). It's a comedy. | User: sweet! my day is planned out now. lol. thanks for  your help | Recommender: No problem!\nUser: Hi there.  Have you seen any good kids movies lately? | Recommender: Hi! I actually have. Have you seen Coco  (2017) ? | User: No, but that's still in theaters. | User: Can you think of something I can see at home? | Recommender: I haven't actually seen Moana , but I hear it's excellent. My nieces won't stop singing the songs. | User: We did see that one. | User: It does have great music. | User: We also like to sing along with Trolls  (2016) | Recommender: Oh, okay, wasn't sure if there was someone out there who also would admit to liking Trolls  (2016)! My kid loves it! | User: We love it. | Recommender: I really want to see the new Paddington 2, but I haven't seen the first one yet (Paddington  (2014)). That one is out on Netflix, I think. | User: What a good suggestion. | User: If we see Paddington  (2014) now then I can plan a second movie night later on for Paddington 2 | User: Thanks so much for the idea. | User: Have a good weekend. | Recommender: Sounds like a plan! You too!\nRecommender: Hi there, can you give me an example of a movie you enjoyed? | User: Hello! | User: I love Mrs. Doubtfire (1993) | User: It is my all-time favorite movie | Recommender: I too really loved Robin Williams. | Recommender: How about Patch Adams  (1998) ? | User: Me too! He was such a good actor, no matter what type of movie he was in. | User: What is that movie about? | Recommender: It's about a doctor that uses humor to treat ill children. | Recommender: It was based on a true story. | Recommender: If that's too serious for you, you should try Hook  (1991) | User: Oh, wow! That sounds like something I’d really like- I need to definitely look into it | User: I’ve seen Hook already. It is such a good movie | User: I also really like Robin Williams in Good Will Hunting (1997) . | Recommender: Another silly Williams movie is Jack  (1996) | User: I haven’t seen that one but I’ve heard great things about it | Recommender: I hope I helped you out today. | User: Thank you for your help! I think i’ll go watch it . | User: Have a good day!\nUser: Hi, how are you doing? | Recommender: i am doing fairly well thank you | Recommender: what brings  you here today? | User: I'm looking for some movie recommendations for tonight. I'll have my 5 year old niece with me so some good animated movies would be nice! | Recommender: oh alright cool! | User: Her favorite movie is Bambi  (2013) | Recommender: maybe she would like Brave  (2012) | User: I've seen it before and I enjoyed it but she didn't | Recommender: oh no. well... in that case perhaps The Land Before Time (1988) would be great | Recommender: and there are enough of them that if she liked them you wouldnt have to watch the same thing over and over | User: That's a great movie!
