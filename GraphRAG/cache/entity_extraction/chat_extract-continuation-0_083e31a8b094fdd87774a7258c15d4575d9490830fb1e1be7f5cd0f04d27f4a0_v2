It's pretty long and dramatic. | User: Oh, I think everyone saw that one!  Jack, I'll never let you go!  (Promptly lets him go)  hehe | Recommender: Or 12 Angry Men  (1997) | User: But yeah, it was pretty good | User: I saw one version of 12 Angry Men  (1957) but it was the older black and white one... it was pretty interesting, haven't seen the newer one | User: Also saw Only the Brave (2017) recently, it was pretty good.  Based on that fire that happened in Arizona a few years back.  Really tragedy. | Recommender: It's a little different but what about The Legend of Bagger Vance (2000). Sports drama. | User: With Will Smith?  I have NOT seen that one.. I'll have to check it out! | Recommender: I really like that movie. | User: Cool!  Well, hey, thanks for the suggestions! | Recommender: Not a problem! | User: You have a great night! | Recommender: Hope you have  a good evening\nRecommender: So, what type of movie are you looking for?  I've seen a lot lately.. | User: I'm interested in comedies.  I really enjoyed 21 Jump Street  (2012) | Recommender: Well, then you gotta see the sequel, 22 Jump Street (2014) I'm told it's funnier than the original. | Recommender: which, actually, I haven't seen believe it or not.. been meaning to, but I happened to catch 22 Jump Street (2014) during a free Cinemax weekend!  :) | User: I have actually seen 22 Jump Street (2014) et, I thought it was equally as good and would love to see more sequels. | User: I have actually seen 22 Jump Street (2014) et, I thought it was equally as good and would love to see more sequels. | Recommender: I also recommend the film Tropic Thunder (2008) it was pretty funny | Recommender: And the movie The Other Guys (2010) was good too | User: Yes, I agree! Tropic Thunder (2008) was definitely a unique movie but very funny! | Recommender: Whatever you do though, avoid Paul Blart: Mall Cop 2 (2015) Uhhhh... | User: I didn't particularly care for The Campaign  (2012) , have you seen it? | Recommender: The first one was actually funny in parts, but the second.. uh.. no. | Recommender: Have not seen that one | User: Yes I agree! Paul Blart: Mall Cop (2009) was pretty good but Paul Blart: Mall Cop 2 (2015) was certainly a let down | User: You should avoid The Campaign  (2012). I am usually a fan of Zack Galifianakis but this one wasn't too good in my opinion. | Recommender: Vacation  (2015) wasn't too bad, it's like a &quot;soft reboot&quot; of National Lampoon's Vacation (1983) | User: I will definitely watch The Other Guys (2010) sometime. Who plays in that? | Recommender: Will Ferrell and Mark Wahlberg | Recommender: BTW National Lampoon's Vacation (1983) is a CLASSIC.  Must watch! If you haven't already | User: Oh really? I have seen National Lampoon's Vacation (1983) but not Vacation  (2015), I'll have to check it out sometime.  Will Ferrell is usually hit or miss but Mark Wahlberg has been in some good movies for sure. | Recommender: Well, hopefully I gave ya some good ones to start out with!  :) | User: I have seen National Lampoon's Vacation (1983) many years ago.  It is very funny.  Can't beat classic comedy! | User: You definitely did! Thanks a bunch and have a good night! | Recommender: You too!\nRecommender: hi, how can I help you today? | User: I'm looking for a good family movie. | Recommender: great, can you give me some examples of some movies you like, to help me narrow my search? | User: Something like The Big Wedding (2013). | User: I think if flew under the radar but I really like it. | Recommender: okay, you may like The Karate Kid (1984) | Recommender: a kid learns karate and fights with karate. | User: I've seen it, not really something I would enjoy. | User: Something more like The Family Stone (2005). I mean more movies about families not family friendly. | Recommender: okay, maybe Kubo and the Two Strings (2016) | Recommender: it also fell under the radar | User: Never even heard of it. | Recommender: Kubo and the Two Strings is a 2016 American 3D stop-motion fantasy film directed and produced by Travis Knight (in his directorial debut) and written by Marc Haimes and Chris Butler. It stars the voices of Charlize Theron, Art Parkinson, Ralph Fiennes, Rooney Mara, George Takei, and Matthew McConaughey. | Recommender: or you may like Cheaper by the Dozen  (2003) | User: Yea, I don't think we are speaking the same movie language tonight. | Recommender: or maybe you may like something more like Wonder  (2017) |\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role":
