Did you get a chance to see The Witch  (2015) ? | User: I didn't!  was it good? | Recommender: I think it was a little graphic, but a lot of people seemed to enjoy it.  Do you prefer horrors and thrillers with a lot of gore, or more psychological? | User: psychological really | User: good question | Recommender: Ah, I see.  You might enjoy The Circle  (2015) ; it's on Netflix and is definitely more of a psychological type.  It's sort of like Cube  (1997) , which is older but kind of along the same lines where people are trapped and have to find a way out, usually at the demise of others. | Recommender: Thank you!  :-) | User: I'll have to give those a look!
