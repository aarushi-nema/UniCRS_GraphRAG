I'm good. And you? | Recommender: I'd like to recommend a movie for you. What type of movies do you like? | User: I am good, thank you.I'm looking for some good romantic/ rom coms. | User: I love movies like Say Anything... (1989) and You've Got Mail (1998) | User: I like any year, older and newer, and am open to anything. | Recommender: Excellent. What about things like An Affair to Remember (1957)  or Some Like It Hot (1959) ? | User: I love those movies! Those are great choices. | Recommender: And, have you seen The Big Sick (2017) ? It came out this year and it was surprisingly funny. | User: I love Teresa Palmer, she came out with The Choice  (2016) which was really good, which is one of my favorite movies. I haven't heard of that movie, what is that movie about? | User: And also, who is in it? | Recommender: It doesn't sound funny, but it is. It was written by this comic and his wife and is a true story about how they met. Basically, they started dating, and he was kind of a jerk, and they broke up, but right after that, she got really sick and was put into a medically induced coma. She hadn't taken his name off of her medical emergency list and he gets called. While he is | Recommender: at her bedside, her parents fly into the area. Now, one of the reasons it didn't work out is because they are from two different cultures and he never told his parents, who were trying to arrange a marriage for him, that he was dating someone. | Recommender: Her parents are played by Ray Romano and Holly Hunter. I didn't know the main comic from before, but he is in some show called Silicon Valley and she was in a movie called What If...  (2012) | User: I know who you are talking about. | User: Well you definintely sold me on that movie | User: It has such a great storyline, thank you so much! | Recommender: I don't know The Choice  (2016) , but I will look it up. | User: No thank you, you were a great help! | User: Have a good day!\nRecommender: Hello there.

Give me second. | User: Love Star Wars | Recommender: You might like The Martian  (2015) . Have you read the book? Inception (2010) has some of the same mind bending ideas. | User: Seen them both, I prefer inception more. | User: I also like Blade Runner (1982) | Recommender: A lot of people say go for Prime  (2005) but I disagree. I found it confusing. I don't think you should pay money to see Blade Runner 2049 (2017) , but you would probably enjoy some of the ideas. | User: See the original from 1982. | Recommender: It isn't relaly a Sci-Fi movie, but if you liked Inception (2010) , you will like enjoy Memento  (2000) . | User: Thanks for that will watch Memento. | Recommender: Yeah, I saw the original, Unfortunately, I saw 2049 first. | Recommender: Great.
