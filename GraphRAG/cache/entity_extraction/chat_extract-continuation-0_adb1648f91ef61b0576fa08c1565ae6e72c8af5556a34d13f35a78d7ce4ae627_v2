I hope you like them. I like dark comedies too and it is sometimes hard to find good movies of that sort. | Recommender: I haven't. I will check it out though. | User: Oh, you should, two out of work British actors, doing everything they can to get loaded... Another good one, little known, it was on Netflix... ahhh, yeah, God Bless America  (2011). Not great art, but fun. | Recommender: Thank You for Smoking (2005) is another one that sort of fits in this category. I will definitely check out the movie you mentioned. I love British acting and humor. | User: Yeah, I meant to watch Thank You for Smoking (2005) when it came out, I'll check that out, too. Thanks for the suggestions! | Recommender: Your welcome. Have a great weekend! | User: You, too! Cheers!\nUser: Hello. I hope you are having a good weekend. Have you seen any good movies you would recommend lately? | Recommender: Hello! Hope you are well, I would love to recommend Gold  (2016) | User: I haven't seen that. What genre would you consider it to be? | Recommender: Gold  (2016) would be considered a drama, has some suspense | User: Sounds good. I'll check it out. I think the last drama I watched was The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo  (2011) | Recommender: Another movie I recently watched was Moana  (2016) | User: That is a new one for me too. I'm getting a lot of good suggestions today. That's good since I want to expand my movie horizons, so to speak. | User: The last movie I saw in a cinema was The Shape of Water  (2017) . I'm normally interested in the Marvel franchises but everyone knows about them. It is nice to get some other suggestions. | Recommender: If you are into Superhero movies, I have become obsessed with Thor: Ragnarok (2017) recently too. The Shape of Water  (2017) I havent seen that yett | User: It's really good. It's a drama and I believe it is up for some awards but it also has a science fiction aspect. Really good movie overall. I watched Thor: Ragnarok (2017) too. Loved it. | User: Thank you for your help.\nRecommender: Hello. I hope you are doing well today. Is there any specific genre you are interested in? | User: HI can you suggest a good movie in that is action packed? | Recommender: Action packed movies.. Have you seen The Bourne Ultimatum  (2007) ? | User: I haven't seen that movie.  Is it a good one? | Recommender: I enjoyed it. It has a lot of action and a complex storyline. There are other movies before it though. It's a series starting with The Bourne Identity  (2002) I think. | Recommender: This movie is a bit older but it has lots of action in Repo Men (2010) | User: I have seen Bourne Identity and it was good. | Recommender: You will probably like the following movies then. I like the ones featuring Jeremy Renner better than the series with Matt Damon. Have you ever watched Looper  (2012) ? | Recommender: I absolutely loved that movie. | User: Have you seen Jumanji  (2017)? | User: I watched it this week at the theater and it was great. | Recommender: No. I haven't caught that one yet. | Recommender: I will look into it. I haven't been to the theater in a while. | User: I haven't seen Looper yet either. | User: This was the first movie I seen in a while at the the theater. | User: Justice League  (2017) was a really good movie too.  Have you seen it by chance? | Recommender: Going to the theater is expensive, especially with a family. The last movie we saw in the theater was Thor: Ragnarok (2017) | Recommender: Yes. I love the comic based movies | Recommender: I thought about recommending movies like Suicide Squad  (2016) but most people already know them. | User: Those are my families favorite.  Yes it is very expensive. | Recommender: My family too. They are what we watch together. | User: I love Suicide Squad. | User: I am looking forward to Black Panther (2018) | Recommender: I am too. We will be going to the theater to see it. We try not to miss any marvel movies when they come out. We were hooked after The Avengers  (2012) | User: That was a good one to watch.  We have all marvel movies out of dvd. | Recommender: That is a good plan. | Recommender: I hope you enjoy your weekend and catch some good movies.\nUser: Hi! Do you know any great scary movies like Poltergeist  (1982)? | Recommender: Im not really into scary movies, but i have watched Freddy vs. Jason (2003) I think is a good movie | User: I'm not really into those versus movies. I've seen it but didn't like it too much. | User: Haunted House  (2004) was another that I enjoyed. | Recommender: Yeah i enjoyed it to. | Recommender: Im more into cartoon movies like Sing  (2016)\nRecommender: hey | User: Hello! | Recommender: hope your day is going well!
