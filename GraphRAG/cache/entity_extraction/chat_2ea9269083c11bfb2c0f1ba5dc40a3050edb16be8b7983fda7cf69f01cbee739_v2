The guy who gets the mob guys bag ends up with it while on vacation in mexico...It's laugh out loud funny! | User: That sounds really good! Is it anything like Weekend at Bernie's (1989)? | Recommender: Have you ever seen Crazy, Stupid, Love (2011) ? That's a great romantic comedy that I loved! | User: I haven't seen that! I have heard good things though | User: I think I'll watch Crazy, Stupid, Love (2011) | Recommender: I've never actually seen Weekend at Bernie's (1989) but if you mention in in response to me talking about 8 Heads in a Duffel Bag (1997) I'm interested! I'll have to look into it! | Recommender: Great! I'm sure you'll like it, and I highly recommend 8 Heads in a Duffel Bag (1997) as well! | Recommender: Have you ever seen When Harry Met Sally... (1989) Because that's a great romantic comedy too! | User: I have seen that! I think Crazy, Stupid, Love (2011) is the one for me. Thanks for your advice! | Recommender: Alright, great! I'm glad I could help! Enjoy!\nRecommender: Hi how are you tonight? | User: hi there.. pretty good .. I would like to see a movie that has Mira sorvino in it?  Do you know any? | User: hi there.. pretty good .. I would like to see a movie that has Mira sorvino in it?  Do you know any? | User: or romantic comedies are okay too.. with any actress | Recommender: Romy and Michele: In the Beginning is a classic or a newer one is Exposed  (2016) | User: nice.. I will check out both of them | Recommender: Also Home Again (2017)  is a newer one with Reese Witherspoon, I also reccomend How to Be Single (2016) | Recommender: I am not sure if you have seen any of those? | User: very nice.. recent movies.. good actresses.. I will watch all of them if I can.. thank you!  and have a great night | Recommender: Have a wonderful night to you as well!\nRecommender: Hello, what kind of movies are you looking for | User: I'm in the mood for a Dustin Hoffman film. Know of any good ones? | Recommender: i love The Graduate (1967) | User: Oh right, Mrs. Robinson. Haven't seen that one in a while. | Recommender: also Rain Man (1988) was a great film | User: yes it was. | Recommender: Tootsie  was also a really good one | User: That's one I never have seen.

They're all a bit different. The Last House on the Left  (2009) is a bit more real life than the rest. The Babadook (2014) is a bit supernatural, and hard to describe. Cube  (1997) and the rest are very intense as I said before, and also hard to describe! | Recommender: I hope that you enjoy some of them, if not all! | Recommender: Thanks for chatting! | User: thanks for the recs have a great night | User: bye | Recommender: see ya\nRecommender: Hello, what kind of movies are you looking for? | User: How about something with Drew Barrymore? | Recommender: Well i love Eti (2008) | Recommender: its a classic | Recommender: also i really liked The Wedding Singer (1998) | Recommender\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}], "parameters": {"model": "gpt-3.5-turbo", "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "temperature": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0}}}
