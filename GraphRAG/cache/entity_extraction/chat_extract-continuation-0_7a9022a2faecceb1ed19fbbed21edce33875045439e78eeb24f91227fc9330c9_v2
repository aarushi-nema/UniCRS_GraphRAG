Identify all entities. For each identified entity, extract the following information:\n   - entity_name: Name of the entity, capitalized\n   - entity_type: One of the following types: [MOVIE, ACTOR, DIRECTOR, GENRE, PRODUCTION_COMPANY]\n   - entity_description: Comprehensive description of the entity's attributes and activities, including **inferred details** based on external knowledge about the movie, actors, genres, or other related data. For inferred details, explicitly mention \"inferred\" in the description.\n   Format each entity as:\n   (\"entity\"<|><entity_name><|><entity_type><|><entity_description>)\n\n2. From the entities identified in step 1, identify all pairs of (source_entity, target_entity) that are *clearly related* to each other.\n   For each pair of related entities, extract the following information:\n   - source_entity: Name of the source entity, as identified in step 1\n   - target_entity: Name of the target entity, as identified in step 1\n   - relationship_description: Explanation as to why you think the source entity and the target entity are related, including **inferred relationships** when details are missing in the text.\n   - relationship_strength: A numeric score indicating strength of the relationship.\n   Format each relationship as:\n   (\"relationship\"<|><source_entity><|><target_entity><|><relationship_description><|><relationship_strength>)\n\n3.
