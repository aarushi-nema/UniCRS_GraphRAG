There must be some other decent movies out there. An older science fiction film I liked is Children of Men (2006) | User: Yes. I am counting days. | Recommender: I'm pretty much the same. Although I saw Murder on the Orient Express (2017) recently and it was pretty good. The main guy has this ridiculous mustache. | User: I've heard of that one. I haven't seen it yet but I'll check it out. I probably won't spend money at the theater for anything but Marvel but I'll watch other things on DVD. | User: Thanks for the suggestions. | Recommender: No problem! | Recommender: Nice chatting with you! | User: You too.\nRecommender: Hi! | User: Hello, I am hoping you could maybe recommend a good comedy? I haven't seen one in a while. | Recommender: Have you ever watched Whatever Works (2009) , or Running with Scissors  (2006) ? | User: I don't believe I've even heard of either of those actually. | Recommender: The first is a Larry David classic | Recommender: The second is a very funny movie about a strange family | User: Is it a comedy like As Good as It Gets (1997)  or more like Zack and Miri Make a Porno (2008) | Recommender: Larry is much like Jack Nicholson in this movie, yes. | Recommender: Do you like Horrible Bosses (2011) ? | User: Yes that was a good one. I like Jennifer Aniston better in that role than in movies like The Break-Up (2006) | Recommender: Yes! | User: I liked Role Models (2008) have you ever seen it? | Recommender: No. Havent hear dof it | Recommender: wow.  Havent heard of it\nUser: Hi, i am looking for a good horror movie to watch tonight. | Recommender: Hello. Horror is a good genre, do you think you'd want something classic or more recent? | User: I would prefer more recent. | Recommender: Excellent. One of the better recent horror movies is Nobody Gets Out Alive (2012) | User: Never heard of that one.  What is it about?  I just watched the new It  (2017) movie and didn't find it scary.  Is it anything like It  (2017) ? | Recommender: It's a revenge horror movie where a father avenges the death of his son by hunting the people who killed him. | Recommender: I also saw It  (2017) and didn't find it scary. It was still a good movie though. | Recommender: Another movie you could try is The Conjuring (2013) it's pretty recent and I enjoyed it. Good reviews too. | User: I will have to check out Nobody Gets Out Alive (2012) .  What is the scariest movie you have seen?  The scariest movie  I have ever seen is The Strangers  (2008) | User: Yes I enjoyed The Conjuring (2013) also. | Recommender: The scariest movie I have ever seen probably isn't very scary but has to do with how old I was when I saw it. I'd say it was The Texas Chainsaw Massacre 2 (1986) . I was young when I saw it so it was quite a fright. | Recommender: I have never seen The Strangers  (2008) but I might look into it, thanks! | User: My sister and her boyfriend took me to see Child's Play  (1988) when I was 8.  Scary for my age, but watch it now and it's not so scary.  So I know what you mean. | User: Thanks for the recommendation of Nobody Gets Out Alive (2012) I am going to go check it out  Have a great day. | Recommender: Yes, Chucky was scary as kid for me too! | Recommender: You too!\nUser: Hi! | Recommender: Hello | Recommender: Have you ever watched The Sixth (1981) | User: No I haven't, what's that about? | Recommender: I was wondering myself. My best friend recommended it. | Recommender: I thought he was talking about The Sixth Sense (1999) | Recommender: Are you still there? | User: Yes | User: I'm not really interested in thrillers | User: Maybe something lighter, like a comedy | Recommender: What about comedy? I liked Life  (2007) | Recommender: Eddie Murphy and martin Lawrence was in this one. I thought it was pretty good. | User: Hmm, that sounds pretty interesting | User: Any other movies along those lines | Recommender: I am thinking the year may be wrong. I think it was made in 1999. | Recommender: I actually liked Groundhog Day  (1993) too. | Recommender: Have you ever seen that one? | User: I haven't, actually | User: I know it's a classic | User: I'll give Groundhog Day  (1993) a try, thank you!\nUser: Hello | Recommender: Hi.  How are you today? | User: Good, you? | Recommender: Great.  Looking at movies right now.  There are so many great ones out! | User: I'm looking for one I haven't seen before | User: Can you recommend one that's either still in theaters or a new release? | Recommender: Oh really?
