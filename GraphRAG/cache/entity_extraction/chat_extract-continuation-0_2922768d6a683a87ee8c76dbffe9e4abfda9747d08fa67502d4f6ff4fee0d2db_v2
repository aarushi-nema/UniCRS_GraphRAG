Well thanks for chatting with me. | Recommender: Been my pleasure hope you have a groovy day. | User: You too, goodbye.\nUser: Hi!  How are you doing today? | User: I like movies like The Nightmare Before Christmas (1993) and Edward Scissorhands (1990) . | User: Do you have any recommendations for me along those lines? | Recommender: Hi, I'm good. I have never seen either of those, I'm not big on Tim Burton movies. | Recommender: I have seen some with Johnny Depp though. I liked | User: Yes I really do like those two combined they work really well together. | Recommender: Did Tim Burton do Alice in Wonderland  (2010)? I liked that one. | User: Yeah he did I think!  I really loved that one too.  The Mad Hatter looked fantastic! | Recommender: I agree, he is what I would think a mad hatter should look like. | User: Alice Through the Looking Glass  (2016) was really good too.  They made the hatter looks NUTS in that one | Recommender: I didn't get a chance to see that one, but I also saw Charlie and the Chocolate Factory  (2005) with Johnny Depp, and I'm pretty sure that is also a Tim Burton movie. That was also a good film. | User: I will have to watch that one!  I knew it was Johnny Depp but didn't know Tim Burton did it! | User: Thanks!\nUser: Hello! | Recommender: Hi, I just finished watching Arrival  (2016), have you seen it? | User: I have not, is it good? | Recommender: It is pretty good if you like movies that kind of don't touch the ground, it's always up in the air, and at the end you think &quot;What did I just watch?&quot; | User: I am more than fine with those types of movies! I'll have to add it to my list, thank you for the suggestion! | User: Do you know of any other movies like that? I do like sci-fi, but any genre works | Recommender: No worries, I like those type too. I felt that way at the end of Thelma  but nothing else comes to mind right away. Can you think of any like that? | Recommender: Sorry, not Thelma , I meant The Matrix (1999) | User: I very much felt that way after watching Dr. Strangelove (1964) | User: Hahaha, gotta love typos ;) | Recommender: I have never seen that one, but I read the plot on Wiki once and was  thinking the same thing. What exactly was that about? | User: The Matrix (1999) is great! | User: Dr. Strangelove (1964) is about a series of events where two countries end up in Nuclear War. It's a dark comedy of errors in some ways. | User: It's very surreal and strange, but very funny. | Recommender: Wait, I have seen that one, I was thinking of the summary I read for Eraserhead (1977). That's the one that was just weird and loopy. | User: Oh, I haven't seen or heard of that one. I'll have to look it up, though! | User: Anyway, it was great to talk with you. Thank you for your suggestions! | Recommender: Cool. Great Chat. Have a great day. | User: Always good to talk to someone who likes these sorts of movies! | User: You too.\nRecommender: Hi, I was thinking of watching The Shining  (1980) this weekend. I watch it once a year, and it always freaks me out. | Recommender: Have you ever seen it? | User: I have, and I love it! | User: I also love The Silence of the Lambs  (1991), for basically the same reasons | Recommender: I do too. as you can tell from the &quot;I watch it once a year&quot; statement. | User: Do you have any other suggestions for movies like that? | Recommender: I love that one too, I like anything with Jodie Foster, like Panic Room (2002) | User: I haven't seen that one, but I think I'll add that one to my list. I like her, too. | Recommender: It's not really on par with The Silence of the Lambs  (1991), but I watch it anytime I see it on TV. | User: Well, not many movies are, so I can't say I'm expecting that! | User: Do you know of any other psychological thrillers? | Recommender: Lol, true, I also liked Flightplan (2005) with Jodie Foster. | User: I haven't seen that one, either. But I'll have to add it to my list as well. | User: Thank you for such great recommendations! | Recommender: You're welcome. Have a great day! | User: You as well!\nRecommender: Hi there what kind of movies are you looking for? | User: Hello, I'm looking for some funny movies. Can you help? Something like Bridesmaids  (2011) | Recommender: Have you seen Bad Moms (2016)? | Recommender: They had a Christmas one too that was at least as funny as the original.\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>RACE (1953)<|>MOVIE<|>A 1953 Mexican drama)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>MEXICAN DRAMA<|>GENRE<|>Race falls under the Mexican drama genre (inferred))\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>THE NIGHTMARE BEFORE CHRISTMAS (1993)<|>MOVIE<|>A 1993 animated musical fantasy movie)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>EDWARD SCISSORHANDS (1990)<|>MOVIE<|>A 1990 romantic dark fantasy movie)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>TIM BURTON<|>DIRECTOR<|>Director of Alice in Wonderland (2010), The Nightmare Before Christmas (1993), and Edward Scissorhands (1990))\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>JOHNNY DEPP<|>ACTOR<|>Actor in Alice in Wonderland (2010), Edward Scissorhands (1990), and Charlie and the Chocolate Factory (2005))\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ALICE IN WONDERLAND (2010)<|>MOVIE<|>A 2010 fantasy movie directed by Tim Burton)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>THE MAD HATTER<|>ACTOR<|>Character in Alice in Wonderland (2010))\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ALICE THROUGH THE LOOKING GLASS (2016)<|>MOVIE<|>A 2016 fantasy movie)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CHARLIE AND THE CHOCOLATE FACTORY (2005)<|>MOVIE<|>A 2005 musical fantasy movie)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SCI-FI<|>GENRE<|>Thelma and The Matrix (1999) belong to the science fiction genre (inferred))\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>THELMA<|>MOVIE<|>A movie)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>DR.
