Can you recommend some good animated movies? | Recommender: Sure. Pixar is my go to studio. | Recommender: Cars 3  (2017) is really good. | Recommender: So was Up  (2009) | Recommender: But my favorite and my kids favorite is WALL-E (2008) | User: I've seen WALL-E (2008) and Up  (2009) | User: Cars 3  (2017) might be fun | Recommender: Also, if you want something more serious, you should checkout Ghost in the Shell: Stand Alone Complex - Solid State Society (2006) | User: It takes place after the original animated film and is a deep psychological thriller. | User: I have not seen the original. But I hear it's a classic | Recommender: It is. A Must see for any serious anime lover | User: I'll check it out. Thanks guy! :)\nUser: Hi! Can you recommend some good anime? | Recommender: Sure. Ghost in the Shell  (1995) | Recommender: It's a classic! | User: I think we just met, lol.

Cool. | Recommender: You should also checkout Evangelion: 2.0 You Can  Advance . Not like ghost, but it's a good political drama | User: that's the new one right? | Recommender: Yeah. If you want to watch the original series, you should, but for a quick over view, watch Neon Genesis Evangelion: Death & Rebirth | Recommender: It explains the series very well | User: cool. thanks!\nUser: Hello? | Recommender: Still looking for anime? | User: lol, I am | Recommender: Umm. Try Final Fantasy VII: Advent Children | Recommender: It takes place a few months after the video game | User: I saw that.

But we all have our perspectives | Recommender: You might also want to watch Kingsglaive: Final Fantasy XV | Recommender: It's based on events from the FFXV video game | User: The game is sweet! I didn't know there was an anime. I'd heard of it, but assumed it was another expansion pack. | Recommender: No it's a movie. | Recommender: There's also Final Fantasy: The Spirits Within (2001) but it doesn't relate to any of the video games.

Like Akira  (1988) | Recommender: Well Vampire Hunter D: Bloodlust (2001) is what you want | Recommender: Or Appleseed  | User: What's Appleseed  ? | Recommender: It's about a soldier who gets made into a cyborg and how it affects his relationship with his partner. | User: interesting.

Reminds me of the series Armitage iii | Recommender: I could see that | Recommender: Also @Berserk The Golden Arc is another great one | User: Is that similar to the anime? | Recommender: It is. But it's an expansion of the story. | Recommender: Also before I forget check out Inuyasha the Movie: Swords of an Honorable Ruler | Recommender: it's not as intense as Berserk The Golden Age Arc (2012) but similar in concept and themse | Recommender: theme* | User: Okay. I'll see. Thanks again man.
