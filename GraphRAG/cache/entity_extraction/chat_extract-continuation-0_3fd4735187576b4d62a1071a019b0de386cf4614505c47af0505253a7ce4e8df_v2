How are you today. | Recommender: Not bad. Yourself? :) What type of films do you enjoy? | User: I'm okay. I tend to enjoy either comedies or action/adventure depending on my mood. | Recommender: Hmmm in terms of action I really liked White House Down (2013). | Recommender: I'd also like to suggest something that's a comedy and action. Rush Hour  (1998). It's hilarious and has great action scenes | User: I have not seen White House Down (2013) but I have seen Rush Hour  (1998) and thought that it was hilarious and entertaining. | Recommender: It is! I also really liked Olympus Has Fallen (2013). Cheesy action but really entertaining overall | Recommender: A few last suggestions that have both comedy and a little bit of action are Zombieland (2009) and | User: Cheesy can make for some good entertainment now and then. | Recommender: Shaun of the Dead (2004) | Recommender: Both funny but will also give you that action adrenaline | User: I've actually seen both of those and found them to be amazing. It was a nice break from regular zombie films like Dawn of the Dead  (2004) | Recommender: Agree! I like how creative the zombie genre can get! Have a great day, bud! I hope I did a good job at recommending | User: You did fantastic. Have a few movies to consider. Thank you!\nUser: Hello there! | Recommender: hey there | User: I just recently saw Star Wars: Episode VIII – The Last Jedi (2017) and was looking for something similar. Any ideas? | Recommender: I love that movie. Have you seen the Star Trek  (2009) Franchise? | Recommender: I wasn't a fan of the series but love those movies | Recommender: I also really like The Guardians of the Galaxy  (2014) series. A good mix of space and fun | User: I've seen the original as well as Star Trek Into Darkness (2013). I also really enjoyed both Guardians of the Galaxy  (2014)  movies. Some of the most fun I've ever had while looking at my TV. | User: I've been in a big sci-fi phase lately. Any other recommendations? | Recommender: They are a lot of fun. Keeping to the space theme, I also really enjoy Galaxy Quest (1999) and The Fifth Element | Recommender: E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial (1982) is great as well, but I'm sure you've seen that ha. | User: I've seen all those except The Fifth Element. I guess I'll have to check that one out tonight. Thanks for the suggestion! | Recommender: No problem! Enjoy your day bud, and I hope my suggestions were useful! | User: Sure thing. Nice chatting. Thanks for your help.\nUser: Hi there! | Recommender: Hi what kind of movie would you like to watch today | User: I'm kind of bored. Was thinking about finding a good comedy to watch. Any ideas? | User: My favorite is Dumb and Dumber (1994) for what it's worth. | Recommender: The Hangover (2010) movies were great | Recommender: I like Dumb and Dumber too | User: I have seen the first two, but have not seen The Hangover Part III (2013) yet. | User: Might have to give that a look. Any other ideas? | User: Preferably something on Netflix. lol | Recommender: Fist Fight (2017) was funny | User: Nice. Will definitely look into that one. | Recommender: The Ridiculous 6 (2015) was good it has Adam Sandler and a netflix original | User: Netflix! That's perfect for me. I've always liked Adam Sandler's movies. Especially Happy Gilmore (1996). | User: I have a couple movies to consider. Thank you for your suggestions and I will definitely check them out. | Recommender: The movie was pretty good. Glad I could help. Have a good day. | User: You too. Take care!\nUser: hellloo | Recommender: Hey there! How's it going? | User: Not bad. How about you? Would you happen to know of an good comedies that came out recently? Along the lines of something like The Hangover (2009) ? I love that movie | Recommender: I'm doing okay. Have you by any chance seen the sequels The Hangover Part II (2011) and The Hangover Part III (2013)? | Recommender: I enjoyed the first one the most, but felt it the others were worth mentioning. | User: I have. The whole franchise. Can you think of anything similar to them? Similar to Bridesmaids  (2011) even, since they're of a similar vein | Recommender: Have you seen the new Ghostbusters  (2016)  yet? I thought that was a similar style of comedy. | Recommender: Otherwise if you're willing to go back over 20 years, I'd always recommend Dumb and Dumber (1994). | User: I haven't. I may check it out. I'm not a huge fan of Ghostbusters (1984) the original so I may actually like the remake lol | User: Oh that's a good suggestion. I was a kid when that came out so was too young to see it | User: I'll have to check it out | Recommender: Yeah, it's a much different\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>WHITE HOUSE DOWN (2013)<|>MOVIE<|>A 2013 action movie that involves a takeover of the White House)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>RUSH HOUR (1998)<|>MOVIE<|>A 1998 action-comedy movie starring Jackie Chan and Chris Tucker)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>OLYMPUS HAS FALLEN (2013)<|>MOVIE<|>A 2013 action thriller movie about a terrorist attack on the White House)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ZOMBIELAND (2009)<|>MOVIE<|>A 2009 comedy-horror movie set in a post-apocalyptic world)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SHAUN OF THE DEAD (2004)<|>MOVIE<|>A 2004 horror-comedy movie about a zombie apocalypse)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>STAR WARS: EPISODE VIII – THE LAST JEDI (2017)<|>MOVIE<|>A 2017 space opera movie in the Star Wars franchise)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>STAR TREK (2009)<|>MOVIE<|>A 2009 science fiction movie rebooting the Star Trek franchise)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>GUARDIANS OF THE GALAXY (2014)<|>MOVIE<|>A 2014 superhero movie set in the Marvel Cinematic Universe)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>STAR TREK INTO DARKNESS (2013)<|>MOVIE<|>A 2013 science fiction movie and sequel to the 2009 Star Trek reboot)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>GALAXY QUEST (1999)<|>MOVIE<|>A 1999 science fiction comedy movie about a group of actors from a canceled sci-fi TV show)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>THE FIFTH ELEMENT<|>MOVIE<|>A 1997 science fiction movie set in a futuristic world)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>E.T.
