Have you seen Moana  (2016) ? | Recommender: Another good movie is The Lego Movie (2014) | User: not yet! Ive been meaning to, I love the Disney CGI movies | Recommender: You should check it out! It's an amazing movie! | User: I loved The Lego Movie (2014) . The Lego Batman Movie (2017) \n\n was absolutely hilarious | Recommender: I love the Lego movies!

Well, thank you for the suggestions! | User: have a great day :D | Recommender: Of course! You as well!! Goodbye.\nUser: Hi! I am looking for a comedy | User: I loved Why Him%3F (2016) | Recommender: No problem. So you're into the moreromantic comedies? | User: yeah kind of, but stupid funny | User: really up for anything | Recommender: Hmmm. Have you seen Bridesmaids  (2011) or The Big Sick (2017) ? | User: I have seen Bridesmaids  (2011) | User: not the The Big Sick (2017) tho. it looks cute | Recommender: I highly recommed it. Funny, romantic, and touching all at the same time. | User: i'll have to check it out | Recommender: The Princess Diaries  (2001) is also kind of in that same realm, and I think that's also a pretty funny movie | User: man i haven't seen that in years | User: i liked it tho | User: great suggesstions. | User: thank you! | User: have a good day! | Recommender: Oh and one more recent one that I forgot about for a second. The Duff (2015) . Very funny and sweet | Recommender: No problem at all! Hope I was of help, and you have a great day! | User: i never saw that actually | User: bye!\nUser: Hi there! | Recommender: hello! What are you looking for today&gt; | User: I'd love some good funny movie suggestions. I love movies like 21 Jump Street  (2012) | Recommender: that's a great one! I like Pitch Perfect (2012) a lot, but it has a heavy emphasis on music and Rebel Wilson is pretty annoying | User: Haha, yeah I have seen it! It was pretty good, but I agree some parts are a little odd. | Recommender: Deadpool  (2016) is fantastic if you like the character of Deadpool, but to be honest if you aren't a fan already it probably isn't worth watching | User: I have never really followed the comics, but I heard it was pretty funny! I might check it out! | Recommender: it has a lot of very raunchy humor. Ryan Reynolds is great in pretty much anything though | Recommender: Neighbors  (2014) is pretty funny, as long as you like Seth Rogan | User: Haha I've heard! I agree. I don't mind raunchy humor. I loved Forgetting Sarah Marshall (2008) | User: I haven't seen Neighbors  (2014) I'll have to check it out! Thank you for the suggestions! | Recommender: I love Russell Brand, he was the best part of that movie! Get Him to the Greek (2010) is worth watching just for the drug scene! | Recommender: you're welcome, have a wonderful day :) | User: Stroke the furry wall! | User: Haha, thanks!

Haha I was just going to ask if you've seen the sequels! Good to know. | Recommender: I saw Taken 2 (2012) and hated it so much I couldn't bring myself to watch the third lol | Recommender: Crank  (2006) and Crank: High Voltage (2009) are very fast-paced, if deliberately stupid, action movies | User: Haha, it's like Saw  (2004) at this point, they need to stop making sequels! | User: Oh I've never seen those, I'll have to check them out! | User: Thank you for the suggestions. | Recommender: they're pretty great, you just have to turn your brain off while they're on | User: Have a good rest of your day! | Recommender: you too, take care :)\nUser: Hello! | Recommender: Hey how are you? | User: Good! you? | Recommender: Not bad at all!
