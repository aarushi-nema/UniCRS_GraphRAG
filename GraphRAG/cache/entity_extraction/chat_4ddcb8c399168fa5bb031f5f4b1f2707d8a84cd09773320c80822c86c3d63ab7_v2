I wasn't a huge fan of Green Room  (2015) , but 13 Ghosts (1960) was an excellent movie! | Recommender: and last but not least a good posession movie like The Rite  (2011) is a winner | User: Definitely a good movie in my books | Recommender: awesome | User: I think I'll check our House on Haunted Hill  (1999) | User: Thank you! | Recommender: oh you will have a blast. youre welcome..and thank YOU! | User: Have a great day!\nRecommender: Hi, how are you? | User: Great. | User: I'm looking for a good super hero movie | User: Something like The Avengers  (2012) ? | Recommender: Batman Begins is a great movie, one of my all time favorites! | User: I do really like Christian Bale.
