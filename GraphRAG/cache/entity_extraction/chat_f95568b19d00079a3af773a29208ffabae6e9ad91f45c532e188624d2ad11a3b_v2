How they can be human like. | Recommender: There's no violence, it's more heart warming in nature. | Recommender: If you like something funnier, what about Air Bud: World Pup (2000) | User: I meant in the filming of the movie. Someone leaked footage of them throwing a dog into water and it being terrified! It was sad and caused a big stir.
