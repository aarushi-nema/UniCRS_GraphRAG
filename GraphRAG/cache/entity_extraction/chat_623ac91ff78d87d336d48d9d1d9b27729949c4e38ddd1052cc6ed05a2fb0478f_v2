That's one of my favorites. | User: With Channing Tatum right? It's been a long time. I need to rewatch it because I don't remember much lol | Recommender: I actually think that's a great one to rewatch, it's pretty funny every time. | Recommender: Have you seen The Lego Movie (2014) ? | Recommender: That one's obviously targeted toward kids but it's actually pretty funny for adults too | User: No I haven't even heard of it! I'll check that one out! Thanks! | Recommender: I would also recommend Thor: Ragnarok (2017) ! | Recommender: I just watched it and it's half action half comedy | User: Another one I haven't heard of! I'm out of touch. LOL I think I'm gonna go with the lego movie.Thanks for your help! | Recommender: Of course, I hope those suggestions helped! | Recommender: Bye\nUser: Hello! | Recommender: Hi! | User: Can you recommend some action movies? | User: I just saw Justice League  (2017) but thought it was a little corny | Recommender: I will sure try! Do you like movies like Taken  (2008) ? | User: I have seen those, I loved them! | User: Liam Neeson is awesome | Recommender: I am not a big fan of the Justice League  (2017)  movie either. | Recommender: Oh I know I love Taken 2 (2012) and Taken 3 (2014)  but the first one was the best in my opinion | User: I agree, the other two were good but it doesn't get better than Taken  (2008) . | User: Also the plots were a little less believable as they went on | Recommender: What about The Avengers  (2012)? It is goofy but still classic I think. | Recommender: Exactly. That is what I thought too. | User: I actually enjoyed that one, I might need to go rewatch it. | User: Thanks for your suggestions! | Recommender: Have a great night. You are welcome. | Recommender: Goodbye | User: you too, bye\nUser: Hello how are you? | User: I was wondering if you could recommend a good movie. | Recommender: I'm great! How are you doing? Can I recommend a movie? | Recommender: Sure what kind of movie are you looking for? | User: Great! I would like to see a movie that is inspirational. | Recommender: okay have you seen The Pursuit of Happyness (2006)? It's a great movie kind of sad but inspirational. | User: I like movies like The Pursuit of Happyness (2006)  with Will Smith.  It was really good. | User: HOw funny. | Recommender: Ha! We're on the same page then. That was a great one | User: It was, made me cry. | User: What else is good? | Recommender: Same here. Another one that I thought was great was The Blind Side  (2009) with Sandra Bullock. That one made me cry too. But it was SO good | User: I haven't seen that one. | User: Awakenings (1990) was good. | Recommender: It's really good another one I would recommend would be Forrest Gump (1994) | Recommender: I haven't seen that one | User: Forrest Gump (1994) is with Tom Hanks right? | Recommender: yes. I love Tom Hanks. It's been awhile since I've seen that but I remember it was a tearjerker for me lol | User: That sounds like a good one to watch.

Have you watched Get Hard (2015) ? I love that movie.

What about The Heat  (2013) with Sandra Bullock and Melissa McCarthy. | User: I LOVE that movie! | Recommender: I do too! | User: It reminds me of 21 Jump Street  (2012) , which is also hilarious | Recommender: Can you believe I have not seen that one myself. | User: I highly recommend it, especially if you liked The Heat  (2013) | Recommender: I like some of the old stuff too with Jim Carrey like Bruce Almighty (2003) . | Recommender: I will check it out. I am bored and may look for that now lol | User: I actually haven't seen that one, but I know it's a classic | User: I'll have to check it out.
