I suppose there are the sequels but that is hardly insightful. | Recommender: The television series The Expanse is currently where I fill that gap in my life. Though that isn't a movie. | User: Creature  (1985) was a decent so bad it's good movie that was actually a response to Alien  (1979) | Recommender: I didn't know that. How about Killer Klowns from Outer Space (1988) for a one off night joke movie. | User: I love that one! cult classic | Recommender: I used to pretend the headlights of cars were clown noses and shoot them with my cousin in the backseat. Memories! | User: Galaxy of Terror (1981) was also great | User: I feel that these days, movies have lost their magic | Recommender: It does seem like they rely on getting quiet and then jump scaring rather than suspense and being terrifying. | Recommender: Not to mention the ongoing issue of just repeating the same story over and over. | User: I like movies that are well made, but I also can appreciate when the film makers did their best with the budget they were given | Recommender: Truly! Ghostbusters (1984) was a thousand times better than Ghostbusters  (2016) | User: many times it works very VERY well, like with Star Wars  (1977) | Recommender: Have you seen the latest Star Wars film Star Wars: Episode VIII – The Last Jedi (2017)? I haven't gotten around to it yet. | User: I can also say that the best sci fi horror movie that came out of the 80's was The Terminator (1984) | Recommender: Predator  (1987), The Terminator (1984), and Aliens  (1986) were the best the 80s produced! Outside of the slew of ski movies I like as a guilty pleasure. | User: I haven't. and I do not plan to. I prefer the original trilogy. I can watch those over and over and not get bored. The Empire Strikes Back (1980)  is definitely the best sci fi film ever made | Recommender: And with that! I must leave. Hope to see you around! | User: take care!\nRecommender: Hello, enjoying your weekend? | User: Yes! | Recommender: Can I suggest a movie to end it right? | User: I'm looking to see a good action movie like True Lies (1994) or Fortress  (1992) | User: I like those! | Recommender: I love True Lies. What about something like National Treasure  (2004) ? | Recommender: HIstorical and some action. | User: Yeah that is a good one I love it! | Recommender: Something similar as well would be Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom (1984) | User: That is also one of my favorites! | Recommender: Sounds like you have good taste! | User: Thank you | Recommender: I only speak the truth. | User: Do you have any other suggestions? | Recommender: You could watch The Italian Job  (2003). | User: I've heard of that one, I will check it out! | Recommender: Sounds good! | Recommender: Have a good end of the weekend! | User: Thanks have a great night Bye!\nUser: Hi! | Recommender: hi, how's it going? | User: great. I'm hoping you can recommend some movies. | Recommender: you looking for a good movie tonight? | User: I am! | Recommender: sure, what genre are you looking into? | User: I really would like to find a good drama. I don't watch drama often, and would like to start. | Recommender: oh great, I like crime/drama such as The Departed (2006) | Recommender: I also enjoyed Captain Phillips  (2013) | Recommender: That one has Tom Hanks in it | User: I have seen both those. I really liked them both especially The Departed (2006). I too like crime dramas. | Recommender: The King's Speech (2010) is a very highly rated movie. award winning | Recommender: Great acting in that movie | User: I've also seen that one, and I remember liking it. For someone who hasn't watched many dramas, I've seen all these! | Recommender: The Shawshank Redemption (1994) is another classic must see | User: I haven't seen it yet, but I've heard it's amazing. | User: I will need to check it out, thank you! | Recommender: That is the one for you! | Recommender: Im sure you will enjoy! | User: I'm sure I will. Thank you! | Recommender: have fun with the movie, good night! | User: Thanks have a good one.\nRecommender: good evening what type of movie are you looking for | User: Hi! I'm looking for something funny. Do you have any thoughts? | Recommender: Daddy's Home  (2015) or Daddy's Home 2 (2017) | User: I haven't seen either of those, so I will definitely have to check them out. | Recommender: or Snatched (2017) d if you like amy schumer | Recommender: yes they are great with mark wahlburg and will fer\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>DRACULA 3000 (2004)<|>MOVIE<|>A 2004 science fiction horror movie that is considered so bad it's funny)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ALIEN (1979)<|>MOVIE<|>A 1979 science fiction horror movie)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>THE EXPANSE<|>MOVIE<|>A television series)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CREATURE (1985)<|>MOVIE<|>A 1985 science fiction horror movie)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ALIEN (1979)<|>MOVIE<|>A 1979 science fiction horror movie)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>KILLER KLOWNS FROM OUTER SPACE (1988)<|>MOVIE<|>A 1988 comedy horror movie)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>GALAXY OF TERROR (1981)<|>MOVIE<|>A 1981 science fiction horror movie)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>GHOSTBUSTERS (1984)<|>MOVIE<|>A 1984 supernatural comedy movie)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>GHOSTBUSTERS (2016)<|>MOVIE<|>A 2016 supernatural comedy movie)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>STAR WARS (1977)<|>MOVIE<|>A 1977 space opera movie)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>STAR WARS: EPISODE VIII – THE LAST JEDI (2017)<|>MOVIE<|>A 2017 space opera movie)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>THE TERMINATOR (1984)<|>MOVIE<|>A 1984 science fiction action movie)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>PREDATOR (1987)<|>MOVIE<|>A 1987 science fiction action movie)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ALIENS (1986)<|>MOVIE<|>A 1986 science fiction action movie)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>THE EMPIRE STRIKES BACK (1980)<|>MOVIE<|>A 1980 space opera movie)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>TRUE LIES (1994)<|>MOVIE<|>A 1994 action comedy movie)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>FORTRESS (1992)<|>MOVIE<|>A 1992 science fiction action movie)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>NATIONAL TREASURE (2004)<|>MOVIE<|>A 2004 adventure mystery movie)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>INDIANA JONES AND THE TEMPLE OF DOOM (1984)<|>MOVIE<|>A 1984 action adventure movie)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>THE ITALIAN JOB (2003)<|>MOVIE<|>A 2003 heist movie)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>THE DEPARTED (2006)<|>MOVIE<|>A 2006 crime thriller movie)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CAPTAIN PHILLIPS (2013)<|>MOVIE<|>A 2013 biographical survival thriller movie)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>THE KING'S SPEECH (2010)<|>MOVIE<|>A 2010 historical drama movie)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>THE SHAWSHANK REDEMPTION (1994)<|>MOVIE<|>A 1994 drama movie)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>DRACULA 3000 (2004)<|>ALIEN (1979)<|>Both movies fall under the science fiction horror genre)<|>\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>CREATURE (1985)<|>ALIEN (1979)<|>Creature was a response to Alien)<|>\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>KILLER KLOWNS FROM OUTER SPACE (1988)<|>ALIEN (1979)<|>Both movies are considered humorous in their horror elements)<|>\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>GALAXY OF TERROR (1981)<|>ALIEN (1979)<|>Galaxy of Terror is a science fiction horror movie like Alien)<|>\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>GHOSTBUSTERS (1984)<|>GHOSTBUSTERS (2016)<|>Comparison of the original Ghostbusters to the 2016 remake)<|>\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>STAR WARS (1977)<|>STAR WARS: EPISODE VIII – THE LAST JEDI (2017)<|>Discussion of the original Star Wars movie and its latest installment)<|>\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>THE TERMINATOR (1984)<|>PREDATOR (1987)<|>Both movies are considered among the best of the 80s)<|>\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>THE TERMINATOR (1984)<|>ALIENS (1986)<|>Both movies are considered among the best of the 80s)<|>\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>PREDATOR (1987)<|>ALIENS (1986)<|>Both movies are considered among the best of the 80s)<|>\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>TRUE LIES (1994)<|>FORTRESS (1992)<|>Discussion of action movies like True Lies and Fortress)<|>\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>NATIONAL TREASURE (2004)<|>INDIANA JONES AND THE TEMPLE OF DOOM (1984)<|>Comparison of National Treasure to Indiana Jones)<|>\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>THE DEPARTED (2006)<|>CAPTAIN PHILLIPS (2013)<|>Discussion of crime thriller movies)<|>\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>THE DEPARTED (2006)<|>THE KING'S SPEECH (2010)<|>Comparison of crime thriller to historical drama)<|>\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>THE DEPARTED (2006)<|>THE SHAWSHANK REDEMPTION (1994)<|>Comparison of crime thriller to drama)<|>\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>CAPTAIN PHILLIPS (2013)<|>THE KING'S SPEECH (2010)<|>Comparison of biographical survival thriller to historical drama)<|>\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>CAPTAIN PHILLIPS (2013)<|>THE SHAWSHANK REDEMPTION (1994)<|>Comparison of biographical survival thriller to drama)<|>\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>THE KING'S SPEECH (2010)<|>THE SHAWSHANK REDEMPTION (1994)<|>Comparison of historical drama to drama)<|>\n<|COMPLETE|>"}, {"content": "MANY entities and relationships were missed in the last extraction.
