It is astoundly awful, yet super entertaining. | User: astoundingly | User: my typing is terrible today, but my film taste is impeccable, lol | Recommender: Great, do you have what you need? | User: I think so. Nice talking to you.\nUser: hello :) | User: I'm looking for a fun comedy movie, possibly animated, but one I can watch without my daughter picking up rude language | Recommender: Hi there, have you seen The Sound of Music  (1965) | Recommender: It is my go to movie | Recommender: She might like something newer like Transformers: Dark of the Moon: The Junior Novel | User: The Sound of Music  (1965) is a bit dated for my tastes to be honest | User: I like the Transformers   series! | Recommender: Did you like the first Transformers  (2007) | User: yeah. I didn't like Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen (2009) though. Got a bit silly | Recommender: Yeah Transformers: The Last Knight (2017)  was better | User: I didn't see that one, I'll have to check it out | Recommender: If you like Mark Wahlberg | User: I didn't care for him in The Happening  (2008) | Recommender: I liked that one | Recommender: he was good in Date Night (2010) | User: I haven't seen that one | User: well, I guess I'll check out Transformers: The Last Knight (2017) .
