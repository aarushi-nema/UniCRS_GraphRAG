I will, they were all ones I liked, or found interesting!\nUser: Hello! | User: I'm looking for some Action Adventure (maybe with some comedy) movies, if you could help me out... | Recommender: Hello! | Recommender: , let me see | User: Some that I like are, Inspector Gadget  (1999) and 21 Jump Street  (2012) as well as Bad Boys  (1995) | Recommender: You might like Airplane! (1980) Tommy Boy (1995) and Men in Black  (1997) | User: Those are all great suggestions! I haven't seen Airplane! (1980)  or Tommy Boy (1995) in years, and I never actually saw Men in Black  (1997) but I always wanted to! | User: The first two are favorites of mine, I love slapstick comedies! | Recommender: You might also like Seven  (1995) for suspense | Recommender: I'm glad you like my picks! I love comedys too! | User: That's one that I may have seen, but if so, it was over 10 years ago. I'll have to look it up! I'm intrigued for sure though! | User: And of course, you seem to have a great taste in movies! Have a nice day, and thanks again! | Recommender: Great! It was nice talking to you | User: Likewise :)\nRecommender: hi | User: Hello! | Recommender: who do you like as far as actors go? | User: I'm looking for some horror movie suggestions, like The Last House on the Left  (2009)   My favorite actors are Wes Craven, Stephen king (as a director and writer as well) and Ken Foree | User: Ken foree was in The Dentist (1996) if you haven't seen it! | Recommender: ok cool | Recommender: let me check and see what i have.... | User: Thanks! | Recommender: Friday the 13th  (1980) Jaws  (1975) | Recommender: A Nightmare on Elm Street (1984)  is good too | Recommender: any of those interest you? | User: Those are all great suggestions, because they're movies I've actually never seen! I've only recently begun watching horror movies outside of halloween season. I always thought that as commonplace as they were, Friday the 13th  (1980) , Jaws  (1975) , and A Nightmare on Elm Street (1984) might be a little bland. I'll definitely add them to my list! | User: Got one more for me by chance? :-) | Recommender: sure do... | Recommender: how about Hostel  (2011) | User: I actually saw Hostel  (2011) and it was intense! Almost too much, but I liked it because it actually scared me, legitimately! | Recommender: hahaha nice! | User: I never saw the second (or third?) ones, have you? I'm not sure if they're any good. | User: Or what they're called if they exist | Recommender: i have seen them all and the second is best i think | User: Alright cool, I can find them on IMDB I'm sure, thanks for the recommendations! | User: I really appreciate it! :D | User: Have a great day!\nUser: Hello! | Recommender: hello! | User: I'm looking for some drama movie suggestions...

Tyler Perrys Why Did I Get Married%3F (2007) was amazing! | User: I haven't seen Why Did I Get Married%3F (2007) but I've heard good things, I'll have to look into that one too! and yes, The Notebook (2004) was great! | Recommender: Its more of a horror based but its based on a true event in Spain and its really good so far! | User: Real quick, on Netflix, there are two movies titled Veronica, released in 2017, you know which one you're watching? | User: It's the one about the seance in the school, correct? | Recommender: correct! | User: 1 hours and 45 minutes? | User: Okay cool, thanks! | Recommender: i didnt even see another one titled Veronica when I did my search. My husband is the one who told me we had to watch it , he heard alot of good things about it from people and hes not even a horror fan. | Recommender: Im a huge horror fan lol | User: Added Veronica  (2017) now!
