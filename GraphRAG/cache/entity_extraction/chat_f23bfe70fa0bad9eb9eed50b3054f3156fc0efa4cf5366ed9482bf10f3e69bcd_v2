It's really sad because most of the people were molested growing up so they associate it as being the norm. | User: M.Night Shamalyn.  He made The Sixth Sense (1999) Unbreakable  (2000) Signs  (2008) and a couple other horrible movies | User: but Split (2017) is good. Its about Three girls are kidnapped by a man with a diagnosed 23 distinct personalities. They must try to escape before the apparent emergence of a frightful new 24th, according to IMDB | Recommender: Oh, sweet. | Recommender: Thanks!\nUser: Hey there. | User: Any good movies out now? | Recommender: I saw Murder on the Orient Express  (2001)  - the new version just the other day. | Recommender: Not the 2001 version | User: I might see that. the new one. yeah. | Recommender: It was okay. Not great. What's your favorite movie of the year? | User: Probably Wonder Woman  (2017) | Recommender: Haven't seen it but I heard it was very good.

Yeah, it's basically all comic book movies. | User: Even movies you didn't know were comics based turned out that they were. | Recommender: Yeah, the studios want franchises and they are easy to franchise. | Recommender: I did see Planes, Trains and Automobiles (1986) over Thanksgiving. Great to revisit that one. | Recommender: So funny still | User: When they plan a movie they basically make a comic story board anyway, so it's a perfect adaptation model. | Recommender: Yes, I hadn't thought about that, but you're right. | User: Yeah, I saw that one. Have a good evening. | Recommender: Good bye.\nRecommender: Hi. | User: Hi there | Recommender: What's your movie taste? | User: I love movies, every genre is fine by me | User: what about you? | Recommender: Have you seen Spider-Man: Homecoming (2017) ? | Recommender: I like most genres.
