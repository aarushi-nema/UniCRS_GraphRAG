I'll have to look it up! | Recommender: There is also a sequel that just released last year. I would also suggest that. John Wick: Chapter 2 (2017) | User: I've never even heard of it and there's a sequel.  I'm going to have to watch both | Recommender: I don't know how old you are, or if you would create any nostalgia for you, but the Power Rangers  (2017) movie is actually really good! | User: I have not seen that one either.  I think Wonder Woman  (2017) was one of the last I've seen that was more an action movie. | User: It was good! | Recommender: Okay, that is a great one! So you are a superhero fan? Have you seen the Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2 (2017) movie yet? | User: I'm not a huge superhero fan but I like some of them!  Guardians of the Galaxy  (2014) was good! | Recommender: I completely agree. How do you feel about Thor: Ragnarok (2017)? | User: I have not seen that one but wouldn't mind seeing it!  I'll have to rent it | User: Thank you for all your suggestions! | Recommender: No problem! Its been a pleasure.\nRecommender: Hello what type of movies are you looking for? | User: Hello!

That was a really good one. The ending was a major twist. | Recommender: So do you like stuff like The Exorcist III (1990) ?  I'm not a horror fan at all but seems most people like that one. | User: I didn't see that one. I wasn't really big on the Exorcist movies for some reason. | Recommender: I think the last horror movie I saw was The Ring  (2002).  I didn't like it but I've heard people that like horror did. | User: It was pretty good. I wasn't too big of a fan of the second one, but the third one, Rings  (2017) was really good. | Recommender: I've heard people like The Conjuring 2 (2016)  movies a lot too! | User: I did see that one. It was really good as well. | Recommender: I've also heard Lights Out  (2016) was a good one for horror fans. | User: I haven't seen that one, and am looking forward to watching it soon! | User: Thanks for the suggestion! | Recommender: YOu're welcome\nUser: Hi can you think of any good movies that have come out recently on DVD?
