(1980). | User: Oh yes, those are great. I haven't seen Airplane in years. | Recommender: Surley it's a classic! For suspense, I think Seven  (1995) or The Shining  (1980) are really good! | User: Those are good too. I saw the shining recently actually. | User: But hey, I think I'm good now. Thanks for the suggestions! | Recommender: Great! Have a nice day. | User: You too\nUser: Hello. Looking for some movies to watch. | Recommender: What kind of movies do you like? | User: Suspense. | User: Drama works too | Recommender: I recently recommended that someone watch Get Out (2017) for suspense. Have you seen it? | User: I haven't. I think I'll check it out. | Recommender: I know more about dramatic movies than suspense though. There are so many great classics. | User: Okay. I'm all for it. | Recommender: The Godfather (1972), is obviously an amazing movie. If you like foreign films City of God  (2002) is beautiful. | User: Oh Yes. City of God was great. Loved it. | Recommender: For a slightly more modern drama, I'd recommend Spotlight  (2015) | User: I haven't heard of it, but I'm willing to check it out. | Recommender: It's a great drama about the Boston Globe and the church. You may like it! | User: Sounds like something I would enjoy. | User: But hey, I think I have enough. Thank you so much for the suggestions! | Recommender: No problem, have a nice day!\nRecommender: Hello | User: hello | Recommender: what kind of movies do you like? | User: I am looking for a good action movie that is not a comic book movie. I recently watched John Wick (2014) and loved it. | Recommender: Ok, have you seen The Foreigner  (2016) ? | User: No, I haven't. What's it about? | Recommender: it's with Jackie Chan, it's a recent movie | User: I stopped watching Jackie Chan movies after Rush Hour  (1998). not a big fan. do you have any other suggestions? | Recommender: The story of humble London businessman Quan (Chan), whose long-buried past erupts in a revenge-fueled vendetta when the only person left for him to love - his teenage daughter - is taken from him | Recommender: really? | Recommender: let me see | Recommender: do you like the taken series? | Recommender: Taken  (2008) | User: You aren't the first person to suggest that movie! I think I'll give it a try! | Recommender: Have you seen The Commuter  (2017) ? | Recommender: haha I now, but maybe you haven't seen his last movie, no the Taken   series but his movies are similar | User: I will check them both out! Thanks. | User: Bye | Recommender: Okay, have a nice day\nRecommender: Hello | User: Hi | User: I like scifi and action movies, like Alien  (1979) and Predator  (1987) series. | Recommender: I'm looking for a children's movie. I just watched Frozen (2013) with my kids and they loved it. | Recommender: Oh sorry. wait | User: lol all good | Recommender: Have you seen Avatar  (2009) ? | User: Yes, it was ok.  The political aspect was a bit much. | User: I just watched Men in Black  (1997) all the way through in one sitting recently.  It was good. | Recommender: So no political aspect. Got it. Well have you seen Ready Player One  (2018)? it's pretty new. but i think you'll like it. | User: No, but it's on the list.  Will wait for the crowds to slow down a bit. | Recommender: Sweet. hope you enjoy it! bye | User: Like most of Speilbergs other scifi films. | User: Still haven't gotten around to watching the new Blade Runner 2049 (2017) film.  loved the 1st one\nRecommender: Hi, | Recommender: What kind of movies do you like? | User: Hi! I'm looking for a good comedy. | Recommender: Adult or tamer? | User: definitely tamer. | Recommender: I recently watched Men in Black  (1997) had forgotten how funny it was. | User: That is pretty good... better than Men in Black II (2002) | Recommender: Yes, I liked it better than the 2nd. | User: I really liked Overboard  (1987) . I think it's underrated. | Recommender: Oh wow, I think they are remaking it.  Kurt Russel was always a fav. | User: I didn't know about the remake. Do you remember Sleepless in Seattle (1993) ? I thought it was a bit cheesy, but pretty good. | Recommender: Goldie Hawn did a bunch of funny 80's comedies.  Seems Like Old Times  (1980) , and Private Benjamin  (1980)  among others | User: Oh!
