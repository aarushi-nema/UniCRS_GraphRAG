Sarah Connor is such an amazing character. I just re-watched Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines (2003) a couple of days ago. It feels so hollow without her in it. Arnold is the star, but Linda Hamilton is really what made The Terminator (1984) and Terminator 2: Judgment Day (1991) such compelling films. | Recommender: She honestly is in incredible\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>HOME AGAIN (2017)<|>MOVIE<|>A 2017 romantic comedy movie)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>THE NOTEBOOK (2004)<|>MOVIE<|>A 2004 romantic drama movie)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>HITCH (2005)<|>MOVIE<|>A 2005 romantic comedy movie)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>BEAUTY AND THE BEAST (2017)<|>MOVIE<|>A 2017 fantasy musical movie)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>TULIP FEVER (2017)<|>MOVIE<|>A 2017 historical romantic drama movie)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>MOANA (2016)<|>MOVIE<|>A 2016 animated musical adventure movie)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SHREK (2001)<|>MOVIE<|>A 2001 animated comedy movie)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SHREK 2 (2004)<|>MOVIE<|>A 2004 animated comedy movie)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>FROZEN (2013)<|>MOVIE<|>A 2013 animated musical fantasy movie)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>THE NEVERENDING STORY (1984)<|>MOVIE<|>A 1984 fantasy movie)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>MARY POPPINS (1964)<|>MOVIE<|>A 1964 musical fantasy movie)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>THE WONDERFUL WIZARD OF OZ (1975)<|>MOVIE<|>A 1975 musical fantasy movie)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>THE FOURTH KIND (2009)<|>MOVIE<|>A 2009 science fiction thriller movie)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>PROMETHEUS (2012)<|>MOVIE<|>A 2012 science fiction movie)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>U.F.O.
