Sarah Connor is such an amazing character. I just re-watched Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines (2003) a couple of days ago. It feels so hollow without her in it. Arnold is the star, but Linda Hamilton is really what made The Terminator (1984) and Terminator 2: Judgment Day (1991) such compelling films. | Recommender: She honestly is in incredible through the whole thing | User: The original Star Wars  (1977) is my favorite by far, but The Empire Strikes Back (1980) and Return of the Jedi (1983) are wonderful too. | User: I don't particularly like the prequel trilogy, Star Wars: Episode I – The Phantom Menace (1999)  and Star Wars: The Clone Wars  (2008) are especially bad. | Recommender: what are your thpughts on Star Wars: The Force Awakens (2015) | Recommender: or Star Wars: Episode VIII – The Last Jedi (2017) | User: It's OK, it's growing on me, but the new trilogy lacks some of the gravitas of the first trilogy. | Recommender: the prequels are slightly less painful if you watch in machete order I think | User: Now the stand alone Star Wars movies look very promising. Rogue One: A Star Wars Story (2016) was excellent, and I have high hopes for the upcoming Han Solo movie. | User: Sorry, machete order? | Recommender: so you do Star Wars  (1977) then The Empire Strikes Back (1980) , Star Wars: The Clone Wars  (2008) Star Wars: Episode III – Revenge of the Sith (2005) and end with Return of the Jedi (1983) | Recommender: it shifts the perspective in some fun ways | User: Interesting, I may have to do that. I have al of the Star Wars films on iTunes. | Recommender: because 2 and three then become flashbacks in the original arc rather than their own messy stand alone thing | User: Oh! Clever! | Recommender: its also just a fun way to kill a weekend if you don't have other plans | User: Hmmm I wonder how Rogue One: A Star Wars Story (2016) would work as a flashback... after Star Wars  (1977) the original? | Recommender: I'm not sure if they have worked in the new films yet but theres lots of discussion if you just google Star Wars  (1977)  and machete order | User: I will do that. Thank you so much for the recommendation! | User: I think we have mentioned enough movies now, thanks for the chat! | Recommender: thanks bye\nRecommender: Hi! What kind of movies do you like? | User: Hello. i am looking for something to really make me laugh. | User: I like movies like The Hangover (2009) | Recommender: Awesome! I like that movie a lot! Have you seen The 40-Year-Old Virgin (2005) ? | Recommender: Bridesmaids  (2011) is a favorite of mine too! | User: I have seen both of those lol | User: more suggestions please | Recommender: How about Superbad  (2007)? That one always makes me laugh. | User: oh I have actually never seen that! I have heard of it but never watched it. I will check that out :) | Recommender: Awesome! I hope you like it! | User: thank you so much for the suggestions! have a great day. goodbye :) | Recommender: Have a great day! Bye!\nRecommender: Hi there! What can I recommend for you today? | User: I like movies like Forrest Gump (1994) | Recommender: Ok. That was a great movie! Are you looking for Tom Hanks movies? | User: Yeah I like Tom Hanks a lot | Recommender: Me too! There is Cast Away (2000) | User: I saw that already anything new? | Recommender: What about Captain Phillips  (2013) | Recommender: If you like the Dan Brown novels there is Inferno  (2016) | User: I don't like to see Tom Hanks in danger  :) | User: I don't like to see Tom Hanks in danger :) | Recommender: LOL! It was really good though. | User: Ok maybe I will watch Captain Phillips | User: Thanks goodbye | Recommender: You're welcome! have a good day\nRecommender: Hey | Recommender: Can I help you find a movie? | User: Hi! | User: Yes please! I like scary movies! DO you have any recommendations? | Recommender: A Nightmare on Elm Street (1984) made it so I haven't been able to sleep in 20 years. | User: SOmething like Halloween  (1978) would be great! | User: Oh that one is awesome. I've seen it! | Recommender: You can also check out The Skeleton Key (2005) | User: I did see that one and it was very creepy! Do you know of maybe another one? | Recommender: or The Ring  (2002) | User: Oh! I need to check The Ring  (2002) out! | User: Great idea! | Recommender: The Glass House  (2001) was also really creepy | User: I haven't seen that one either! Thanks! SOunds great for a creepy movie! | Recommender: I am really particular when I like horror movies but that's\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content":
