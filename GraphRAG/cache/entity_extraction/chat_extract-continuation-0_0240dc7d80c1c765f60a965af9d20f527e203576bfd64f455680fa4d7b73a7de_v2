How about The Nutty Professor (1963) | User: Never seen either one! | Recommender: Or, if you like the best comedy ever, there's always The Pink Panther  (1963) | User: I'll give them a shot! | User: Haven't seen that one either! | User: Thanks for all your help! | User: Have a great day!\nUser: Hello! | Recommender: Hello! How are you today? | User: Great, how are you? | Recommender: Doing well, thank you. What kind of movies are you looking for today? | User: I'm looking for a great comedy. Something similar to Horrible Bosses (2011) or Why Him%3F (2016) | Recommender: If you're looking for a great comedy, assuming you are okay with some adult humor and religious irreverence, I highly recommend Dogma  (1999). | User: Never seen that one | Recommender: It also has Jason Bateman. | User: Just added it to my watchlist! | Recommender: It's quite good. Also stars Alan Rickman. Slightly dark, more than slightly irreverent, but very funny and very good! | Recommender: Excellent! | User: Have you ever seen Fist Fight (2017) ? | User: I just watched that one last week it's pretty funny | Recommender: I have not seen that one yet. | Recommender: I'll have to look it up myself, thank you! | User: Well it was nice chatting with you! | User: Have a great day!\nUser: Hello! | Recommender: Hello! | Recommender: What kind of movies are you looking for today? | User: I'm looking for a great comedy film. Something similar to Horrible Bosses (2011) and Fist Fight (2017) | Recommender: I believe we just chatted before, hahahahahahaa | User: Haha | User: I figured this would happen eventually | Recommender: I'd also suggest that you look at Dr. Strangelove (1964). It's another dark comedy. | User: Never seen that one! | User: It's an oldie! | Recommender: Yes, it's an older movie, but it's a favorite one to quote in our household. A bit unusual the first time you see it, but worth the watch. | User: I might have to give it a try then! | User: Any other good recommendations? | User: Charlie Day is hilarious. Any good movies with him in it? | Recommender: You might also want to try Death to Smoochy (2002). | User: Okay I'll try that one | User: Haven't seen it yet | Recommender: Believe it or not, he's in The Lego Movie (2014). It's not dark, but it's very sweet and funny. | User: I heard good things about the lego movies! | User: Thanks for reminding me | User: I'll try that one to! | Recommender: You are quite welcome.

Hope you like hearing all about these comedies, at least! | User: Yeah I don't mind! Except now I want to go watch them all! | Recommender: You could also try The Birdcage (1996). It starts slow but is very funny. | Recommender: Hahahaha, yes, that is one of the hazards of this type of chat! | User: I feel like i've watched that but I cant remember | Recommender: I'm going to be watching that one today. The plot is a little complicated, but it stars Nathan Lane, Hank Azaria, and Robin Williams. | User: Well it has Robin Williams in it so thats cool | User: I just added it to my amazon watch list :) | User: Well it was nice chatting with you again! | User: I'll probably talk to you soon!
