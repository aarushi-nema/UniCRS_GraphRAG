It is very unique and very fun to watch. | User: I'll look into it! Sounds like a movie I'd like. | User: Thanks for the suggestions. | Recommender: I think it might! Have a great movie day! | User: Goodbye!\nRecommender: hi what kind of movie do you want to see ? | User: Hi. I want to see an action film | Recommender: Funny like 21 Jump Street  (2012) or serious like John Wick (2014) ? | User: Interesting. I would suggest  a funny one like 21 Jump Street  (2012) | Recommender: I would recommend Beverly Hills Cop (1984) and Pineapple Express  (2008) | Recommender: and Hot Fuzz (2007) | User: I like to be able to laugh when watching a film but also be entertained by the action. Beverly Hills Cop (1984) sounds like buddy cop movie which is similar to the genre | User: What can you say about Pineapple Express  (2008) ? | Recommender: if you like buddy cop movies, then there is Lethal Weapon (1987) | Recommender: Pineapple Express  (2008) is a comedy with a faire share of action, but no stunts like Beverly Hills Cop (1984) | User: I like the fact that these films are from a different era. I also love a bit of nostalgia. It sounds like Pineapple Express  (2008) may not have enough action for my liking | Recommender: Beverly Hills Cop II (1987) had a car chase with a semi truck quite spectacular | User: Wow! Would love to see how they pulled that off. Any stars in it? | Recommender: there is Eddi Mruphy and Judge Reinhold | User: Sounds exciting. Would you say it's family friendly? | Recommender: They are action film with cops, you will have gun and drugs | Recommender: except Hot Fuzz (2007) , this one only has guns | User: It doesn't sound too bad. As long as there is an adult in the room anyway. | Recommender: There is no excessive violence like RoboCop (1987) | Recommender: This one is not family friendly | User: I did like RoboCop (1987) but did think it was quite violent | User: It's good to hear that these ones are less so | User: These suggestions have been so helpful. I definitely appreciate your recommendations | Recommender: have a nice evening | User: You too. Thanks\nUser: Hi! | Recommender: Hey! What's one of your favorite movies? | User: I'm looking for movies similar to The Nutty Professor (1963) | Recommender: Oh that is such a good one! | Recommender: Have you seen Tommy Boy (1995) ? | User: Nope, I haven't seen that. | Recommender: it's one of my favorites. Chris Farley and David Spade. VERY FUNNY | User: Love both of them! | User: Looking for any comedy really. | Recommender: They also did another movie together called Black Sheep  (1996) | User: Great! Haven't seen that one. | Recommender: The Waterboy (1998) is also very funny! It has Adam Sandler in it! I love all those actors. | User: I used to love David Spade on Just Shoot Me. | User: I love The Waterboy (1998) too | Recommender: I should watch that lol. I havn't seen that show yet. | User: Haven't seen The Waterboy (1998) in a long time. Will have to watch it soon. | User: Thanks for the recommendations! | Recommender: Agreed. | User: Have a good day | Recommender: You're welcome you too!\nUser: Good evening! | User: I was wondering if you could suggest a movie about a wedding. | Recommender: Good evening! Have you ever seen Meet the Fockers (2004) ? It's not explicitly about a wedding but I believe it leads into it. | User: Oh my goodness!  That movie is absolutely hilarious!  Did you see the prequel, Meet the Parents (2000) ? | User: I love comedies! | User: Did you ever see Father of the Bride  (1991) ? | Recommender: Me too! I'm not sure, I may have. What happens in it? It sounds really familiar. | Recommender: That one I have not seen! | User: In Meet the Parents (2000), Gaylord has to meet his girlfriend's parents.  The Dad really gives him the runaround. | Recommender: Ahhh yes! That's the one. I really wanted to smack Gaylord in that one. He could have avoided a lot of problems if he just stopped lying! | User: One of my favorite parts was when he said that he milked a cat. | Recommender: How about The Wedding Planner (2001) ? I don't think this one is as funny but it's kind of like a fairytale if you're into romance. | Recommender: That was truly horrifying, haha! | User: I agree.  The Wedding Planner (2001) isn't quite as comical.  It's more of a chick flick, I guess.  I liked it, though. | User: Thanks for all of the suggestions!  I am excited to get out the tissues! (from laughing or crying!) | Recommender\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}], "parameters": {"model": "gpt-3.5-turbo", "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "temperature": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0}}}
