I prefer his older stuff though. | Recommender: Click  (2006) was a really good movie | Recommender: So was Mr. Deeds (2002) | User: That movie was great! But surprisingly deep! | Recommender: Definitely! | User: Mr. Deeds (2002) was pretty funny as well! | User: I'll have to watch those this week! | Recommender: Blended  (2014) is a newer movie but also super funny | User: Oh, I haven't seen that one, I'll have to check it out! | User: Thank you for the suggestions | Recommender: You're welcome, have a great day! | User: You as well! Goodbye!\nUser: hello | Recommender: Hi | Recommender: What type of movies do you like? | User: See any good thrillers or comedies lately? | Recommender: It  (2017) t was not too bad, more a scary movie than thriller but plenty of thrills there too | Recommender: Also The Cobbler  (2014) with Adam Sandler was pretty funnny | User: Yea that one looks intense lol. A lot of these newer horror movies are getting more and more intense. The Conjuring (2013) was pretty intense too, as well as Drag Me to Hell (2009) | Recommender: Insidious  (2011) was crazy intense | Recommender: You know the last true thriller I watched was Shutter Island  (2010) with Leonardo DiCaprio | User: Sandler has been slacking lately. His last one I loved was Click  (2006). I've seen Insidious: Chapter 2 (2013) , but not the original! Maybe that's why I didn't like it lol | Recommender: The first Insidious  (2011) was kind of sick if you give it too much thought, I mean come on using kids as serial killers | User: I'll have to check out It  (2017) . You're one of many people who have said good things! Thanks for the pick!

I think i will end up watching The Notebook (2013)   thank you | Recommender: Your most welcome glad I could help and have a great night! | User: Have a  good night!\nUser: Hello! | Recommender: Hey, have you seen Not Fade Away  (2012), it has a great soundtrack | User: I have not seen that!  What is it about? | Recommender: A bunch of kids in the 60's trying to form a band to become famous | Recommender: Really Not Fade Away  (2012) is okay but the music is great | Recommender: Also The Cobbler  (2014) with Adam Sandler was pretty interesting | User: Hmm.  I do like movies with good music!  I have not seen either of those.  But I did like the music in Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2 (2017) !  It had a great soundtrack. | Recommender: Cool, haven't seen it yet. Really enjoyed Logan  (2017), though. Good ending to an awesome character | User: Oh absolutely!  Logan was really good. | User: Thanks for those movie reccs.  I will have to look them up and check them out  - if for no other reason than the music!\nRecommender: Hello!

I would hazard against watching The Emoji Movie (2017) as it was awful.  But The Secret Life of Pets (2016) was quite good. | User: Lol I have to agree about the The Emoji Movie (2017) haha and The Secret Life of Pets (2016) is one I have yet to\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}], "parameters": {"model": "gpt-3.5-turbo", "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "temperature": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0}}}
