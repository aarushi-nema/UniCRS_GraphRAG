Have a good night. Bye. | Recommender: You are very welcome bye take care\nRecommender: How can I help you with today? | User: Hello! | User: I am looking for a good romance. Do you have any suggestions? | Recommender: What about Dear John  (2010) ? | Recommender: This is a great film. | User: I have seen that one. It wasn't my favorite. | User: Sorry... | Recommender: How about A Walk to Remember (2002) ? | User: I've seen that one too. | Recommender: Did you like it? | User: It was okay. I think the high school scene is not my thing. I really like Pretty Woman (1990) with Richard Gere and Julia Roberts. | Recommender: How about the film Titanic starring Leonardo? | User: Yes. I've seen that one too. | Recommender: Titanic  (1997) | Recommender: Did you also like this film as well? | User: I liked that one. It's a bit long, but it was good. | User: Any other suggestions? | Recommender: Is there other suggestion I can provide you with? | User: Switching gears... how about a western? | User: I've seen a few old ones with John Wayne like Chisum (1970) and really enjoyed it. | Recommender: How about Appaloosa  (2008) ? | User: I haven't seen that. Who is in it? | Recommender: This one seems western as well. | Recommender: Robert Jauregui | Recommender: Jeremy Irons | User: Okay. I'm not familiar with him, but  I'll have to check it out. Thank you. Have a good night. Bye. | Recommender: Is there other suggestion I can provide you with? | User: I think that is good. Thank you! | Recommender: Bye | User: Bye.\nUser: Hello there | Recommender: Hello! How are you? | User: I am good.  Not bad.  Not great  :D | Recommender: I know what you mean! What kind of movies do you like? | User: Well, I think I would like to switch it up. | User: I wanted to know from you what the lousiest movie you've ever been forced to watch was. | User: Like you wanted to walk out of the theater, but couldn't. | User: Or you were trapped watching it and couldn't escape. | Recommender: Napoleon Dynamite (2004). I was with my friends who were laughing so hard and I couldn't even fake a laugh. I was with my boyfriend too. | Recommender: It was painful. Have you seen it? | User: I did, and I liked it.  But I realize it's not for everyone.  You kinda have to be from the empty Western US states to 'get it'.  I do live the next state over from ID. | User: To someone from New Jersey, it would be an alien culture. | User: That movie is about Mormons. | User: Mormon way of life.  Never mentioned at all in the movie, but it's abundantly clear to people who know. | User: Sorry, didn't mean to be a pest there. | Recommender: I must have missed that. I'm very familiar with the religion. | User: Ah, okay say no more. | Recommender: Well another painful one was You Don't Mess with the Zohan (2008) with Adam Sandler. | User: Heh.  Now that's the religion I'm familiar with.  :D | Recommender: Poor Adam Sandler, he has quite a few that were pretty bad. Did you see that one? | User: It was painful indeed. | User: I did.  The beach scene with the ocean perch in his rear end cheeks. | User: Made me wanna leave. | Recommender: Oh gosh... don't remind me! | User: It is kinda Tel Aviv-y | Recommender: Kind of different, but did you see The Golden Compass  (2007)? | User: Is that the one that iTunes gave away for free?  With the kids? | User: It's like zero out of five stars. | Recommender: Probably. That movie cost so much to make and they had to have lost so much money. | User: Let that be a lesson to them I guess | Recommender: It had a big cast, but didn't quite come together well. | User: My offering is for Popeye  (1980) | Recommender: I don't know that one? | User: It's a Robin WIlliams film so you might stumble across it and think it might be good.  It is so lousy that it will give you gas. | Recommender: Too bad. I really liked him. | User: It's old, but was supposed to have been a landmark musical.  Cost a fortune to make.  Try to imagine a musical based around the Popeye cartoon character. | User: The whole movie is singing. | User: BAD singing. | Recommender: Oh wow. That just sounds awful. I like some musicals, but this just doesn't sound right. | User: hehhe | User: I agreee | Recommender: Well, I hope you have a good night. Bye! | User: night\nRecommender: Hello! | Recommender: How are you tonight? | User: I am doing great! | User: How about yourself? | Recommender: Doing well thank you! | Recommender: What kind of movies do you like? |\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}], "parameters": {"model": "gpt-3.5-turbo", "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "temperature": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0}}}
