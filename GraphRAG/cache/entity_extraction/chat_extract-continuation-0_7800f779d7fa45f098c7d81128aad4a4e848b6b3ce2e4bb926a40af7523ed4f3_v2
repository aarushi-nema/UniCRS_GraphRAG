Even something like Game Night (2018) plays on that too, despite being mostly a comedy | User: Have you ever watched Insidious  serie? That's the kind of a horror movies I like too, fast paced with little times of suspense but gets you back to the jumpscares. | Recommender: Well to be honest I don't really like horror movies that much, not my favorite genre so I don't really watch a lot of them. Hope some of suggestions help though. | User: I think we can wrap this up, I like the suggestions so far so I'll give it a try. Thanks!\nRecommender: What are your favorite types of movies? | User: Hi there, Could you help me out seeking a movie for tonight? | User: My favorite types are: Action movies, like fast paced ones. Horror movies, Sci Fi movies. | Recommender: I like The Graduate (1967) | Recommender: That's a classic | User: Could you describe me that one | Recommender: For horror movies, you can't go wrong with A Nightmare on Elm Street (1984) | User: Yes, that one are on my favorite movies. But I want something new. | Recommender: Signs  (2002) is a great scifi movie | Recommender: It has Joaquin phoenix | User: Now you have my attention, it sounds interesting. Could you give me a little review about Signs  (2002) ? | Recommender: It's family orientated, aliens invade, and it shows people freaking out and wondering how to survive. | Recommender: I liked the suspense. | User: I'll totally add it to my watch later list, thanks! | Recommender: Arrival  (2016) is a new sci fi that I've heard great things about too | User: Oh, that's kind of new: from 2016. Thats another one that goes to the list! | User: I think I have already for a night! thank you.\nRecommender: Hi. | User: Hi | Recommender: What kind of movie are you interested in this evening? | User: I just finished watching The Mummy  (2017) its the one with Tom Cruise.  Have you seen it? | Recommender: Yes I did watch it.  It was okay. Not really a Tom Cruise fan except for the oldies like Top Gun (1986) | Recommender: Are you a Tom Cruise fan? | User: Yeah. But I kinda liked the society to protect the world from evil, plot line.  I thought The Mummy  (1999) was okay but a bit too much drawing from Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom (1984) | User: so anyway I'm looking for a film that is a mix of ancient mystery in modern day. | User: it doesn't have to be Tom Cruise in it | Recommender: Can't go wrong with the Indiana Jones  movies if you like adventure. | User: saw it.  liked it. but looking for current film | User: like last 5 years? | Recommender: I would recommend Inferno  (2016)  in the The Da Vinci Code  (2006) series. That's ancient mystery right? | Recommender: Or somewhat anyway. I love that series | Recommender: And Tom Hanks is just amazing in all of them. | User: I dont know Inferno  (2016) but yeah The Da Vinci Code  (2006) would fit the bill.  Never seen it.
