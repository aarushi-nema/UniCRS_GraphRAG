I appreciate your help very much! | Recommender: You have to catch up on your horror films! | Recommender: You are missing out on so many good movie! | Recommender: I think we are done here. Have a great day!\nRecommender: Hello. | Recommender: Is there a genre of films you are normally interested in? | User: Most of the movies, as longs as they are good. Have you seen 12 Strong (2018) ? | Recommender: No I haven't. I'm sorry. | Recommender: If you give me a minute I'll look at though. | User: Its a really good movie about the first battle that took place in afghanistan against the Taliban after 9/11 | User: You should see it! | Recommender: Oh ok. That does sound very good. I'll look into it. Are you interested in movies concerning events in reality? | User: Yes, I like those movies a lot. Another one I enjoyed was Lone Survivor (2013) and American Sniper (2014) | User: What do think about those? | Recommender: I did watch American Sniper (2014) . It was great but very emotional | User: Black Hawk Down  (2002) is one of my favorites. I watched it like 10 times. And yes, American Sniper was emotional. | Recommender: Have you seen Thank You for Your Service  (2016) ? It was a very good film too. | User: No, is it good and what is it about? | Recommender: 13 Hours: The Secret Soldiers of Benghazi (2016)  was very interesting and thought provoking as well. | User: Yes, I enjoyed that movie as well. | Recommender: Thank You for Your Service  (2016) concerns soldiers returning from Iraq and their difficulties in entering society again. | User: That sounds interesting and emotional as well. Will definitely check it out. | User: Alright, thanks a lot for chatting with me. | Recommender: You're welcome. Have a good evening.\nRecommender: Hello, how are you? | User: I am doing well. Yourself? | Recommender: Good. | Recommender: What kind of movies do you like to watch? | User: I recently watched an older movie The Matrix   and It  (2017)  based on a Stephen King novel. I am not set on any specific genre, just some interesting films. | Recommender: Ah yes, It  (2017) -- I've heard a lot of good things about that one. | User: It was great, although now I don't want to wait for the second half. I have no patience at all really. The original It (1990)  was a good movie too. | Recommender: Have you seen Get Out (2017) ? | User: No. I have heard of it though. Is it good? | Recommender: Yes, it is very good.  Or there's Thor: Ragnarok (2017) which I also hear is quite good. | User: It is. It was. I caught that one in theaters. The only movies I ever watch at a theater are the Marvel movies. I haven't missed one yet. | User: I will watch the movie you suggested. Probably later this evening. Thanks for your help. | Recommender: You're welcome, have a good night.  Bye | User: Bye\nRecommender: Hello. | User: Hello!  How are you? | Recommender: I am fine. I hope your enjoying your evening as well. Are you looking for a specific genre today? | User: Yes, either scary movie or psychological thriller.  I really liked The Silence of the Lambs  (1991), I know it's a bit old but I haven't found its equal yet. | Recommender: Yes that is a unique movie that nothing else really compares to. Have you seen the other movies in that story arc such as Red Dragon  (2002) ? | Recommender: Seven  (1995)  is a good movie with a psychological aspect. | User: I liked Red Dragon  (2002) and Hannibal  (2001) both.  I haven't seen Seven  (1995) yet, that sounds intriguing. | User: Do you know of any other good ones? | Recommender: I really enjoyed it. I don't know if The Hateful Eight (2015)  belongs completely in these categories but it was an awesome movie. | Recommender: Kiss the Girls  (1997)  is a good one based on a novel. | User: OK, that sounds good also.  I will check those out.  Thank you for the ideas! | Recommender: You're welcome. Have a good night | User: You as well.  Bye.\nUser: Hello. | Recommender: Hello. What sort of movies do you prefer? Is there anything you've watched recently you really enjoyed? | User: I'd like a good movie thats a comedy.  I havne't seen any really good movies lately.
