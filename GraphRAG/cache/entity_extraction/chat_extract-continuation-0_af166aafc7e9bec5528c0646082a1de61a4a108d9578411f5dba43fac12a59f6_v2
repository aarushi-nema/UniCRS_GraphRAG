It's Daniel Day-Lewis giving a wonderful portrayal of the 16th President who's navigating the Civil War. | User: No I haven't seen that movie yet. The story line sounds interesting. | User: I'll check out the trailer later. | Recommender: You mentioned Leo, and I've got another Daniel Day-Lewis film: Gangs of New York (2002) .  It's a snapshot of New York City in the early 1860s. | User: ANy other must see movies you can suggest? | Recommender: It's also got a revenge plot, but the acting and writing are really good. | User: Sounds like I have to see it! | User: Which one is better? | Recommender: It depends on what I'm in the mood for, but I'm more into Lincoln.  I was born near DC. | Recommender: Of course, there's the Holy Grail of drama: The Godfather (1972) .  It's three hours long and gets thick in dialogue, but it's a great one. | User: Thanks for the feedback. Looks like I'm watching Lincoln  (2012) | User: Thanks for all your suggestions! | Recommender: No problem!  Enjoy the films.  :) | User: I'll be watching them this weekend. | Recommender: Take care!\nRecommender: Hi. | User: Hey! Hope your day is well. Do you happen to know any good movies like This Is the End (2013) | Recommender: Is that the one with Simon Pegg, Nick Frost, and Martin Freeman? | Recommender: The bar is called &quot;The End&quot;? | User: That film or even Shutter Island  (2010) with Dicaprio was amazing | User: Nope that was with Seth Rogan and James Franco | Recommender: OH!  That one. | User: They were also in The Interview (2014) | Recommender: Gotcha.  :) | User: Have you seen that one about North Korea? | Recommender: Okay then, if you want another apocalyptic comedy (less gorey and more of a happy ending), there's Seeking a Friend for the End of the World (2012) . | User: Ive never heard of that movie actually | User: I think i may end up watching Seeking a Friend for the End of the World (2012) | User: Thank you so much for your recommendations today. | Recommender: It's Keira Knighly and Steve Carrell spending the last few days before earth is destroyed looking for a way for her to get home. | User: Oh wow I love Carrell's work in everything he does. Thank you!\nRecommender: Hi. | User: Hello! | User: I just saw Mad Max: Fury Road (2015) and was looking for a similar fun, action movie. | Recommender: Hmm...that's a tough one, but I might be able to help you. | Recommender: Have you gone back to the series roots with Mad Max (1979) ? | Recommender: My favorite is Mad Max 2 (1981) , but Mad Max Beyond Thunderdome (1985) isn't bad either. | User: I've seen all of them except Mad Max 2 (1981), which I've heard is the best of the original trilogy. | Recommender: I loved it.  :) | User: Any fun modern movies that you can think of? | Recommender: How do you feel about superhero movies?  I really enjoyed Thor: Ragnarok (2017) .  The soundtrack is a throwback to 1980s Sci-Fi and the comedy perfectly peppers a fun action film.  Plus, Jeff Goldblum. | User: Oh that actually sounds perfect. I'm trying to catch up on all the Marvel stuff. I'll be going with that tonight. Thanks for the recommendation! | Recommender: No problem.  Enjoy! | Recommender: Have a great night!\nRecommender: Hello | Recommender: Have you seen any good movies lately? | User: Hi there! | User: Well I just saw Requiem for a Dream (2000) and am looking for something a bit more happy. | User: Just anything cheerful. | Recommender: I've never seen that one. | User: It's depressing | Recommender: I watched Cars 3  (2017) recently. | Recommender: That was pretty cheerful. | User: I haven't seen the first two. I do enjoy Pixar movies though. Toy Story 3 (2010) was fantastic. | User: But yeah, just wanna watch something happy. | Recommender: Since you like Toy Story 3 (2010) you should also try The Secret Life of Pets (2016) | Recommender: It's very funny. | User: Oh that's perfect. Been wanting to watch that but forgot about it. | User: Will check that one out today. Thanks for the recommendation! | Recommender: Another one that I like is The Aristocats | User: That's a classic. | Recommender: I've liked that one since I was a kid and it still makes me laugh! | User: Awesome. Think I'll be going with The Secret Life of Pets (2016) for now. Thanks. :) | Recommender: You're welcome | User: Have a good day. | Recommender: One more came to mind, if you're into\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant",
