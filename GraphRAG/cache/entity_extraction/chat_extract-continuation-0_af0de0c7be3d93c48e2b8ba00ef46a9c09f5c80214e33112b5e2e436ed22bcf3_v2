I was so nervous to go see a movie with terrible reviews but I ended up loving it. I guess everyone has different things that like in a movie | User: Have you ever watched a cooking movie? | User: It's a fad now. They have shows and movies about all kinds of cooks. | Recommender: The only one I've seen is Eddie's Million Dollar Cook-Off when it was on Disney Channel | Recommender: But it was actually pretty good. My kids used to love it | User: Disney channel used to have some pretty good shows. I haven't watched that channel in forever, but I bet it was good. | User: Maybe, I will watch that. There's nothing like a light-hearted comedy. | Recommender: Yes, I saw it probably ten years ago but you should definitely check it out!

It is about a little girl that becomes a troll, and her family doesn't realize it, but the brother finds out. The troll is the antagonist. | User: Oh, I thought it might be like Trolls  (2016) where the Trolls are good guys. | User: Have you seen an romance movies lately? | Recommender: No, it isn't a cartoon. It is just a fantasy movie. | Recommender: I have seen Walk Like a Man  (1987) | User: I do not think I have seen that one. | Recommender: That was a good one with Howie Mandel.
