Watch else ya got? | Recommender: As for classic films, I'd recommend A Christmas Story (1983) . You can never gone wrong with that one. | User: I love that movie. I watch it every year. I hear they are turning it into a live musical. wonder how that's going to play out. | Recommender: I dunno, but the live musical versions of the Wiz and Grease were great so maybe this will be too. | User: Hope so. | Recommender: If you ahve kids, a good animated movie would be The Polar Express  (2004) . Tom Hanks does a voice over of the conductor. | User: Okay, we'll look into that.

The 1947 version. | User: Is that one in color or black and white? Not that it matters, I just don't remember. | Recommender: I think it's in black and white but I'm not sure. | Recommender: Holiday Affair (1949) is in black and white, and is along the lines of the noir variety. | Recommender: It stars Robert Mitchum. | Recommender: Another good one is Holiday Inn  (1942) with Bing Crosby. | User: I've enjoyed mitchum and crosby in other films but I've not seen these. I'll check them out. Hopefully I can find them online. | Recommender: Try Amazon, they have a huge catalog of films to rent. So does Directv. | User: Okay.
