Good movie! | Recommender: The other night, I saw The Golden Compass  (2007) which was great, but I recommend reading the books first ;) | User: I haven't read a book in years | Recommender: I haven't either. My boyfriend read the series, but I have not. It is still a good movie having not read the books, but I'm sure it would be better if I had. | Recommender: Have you seen Jumanji  (2017) the new one? | User: No, I'm really really tired of remakes and everything.. the corresponding spiderman movie siereis really killed my desire to follow along anymore..

I haven't seen the new Jumanji  (2017) and I definitely agree about the spider man series | User: Sigh. | Recommender: But I've got to go for now.
