Or how about 2012  (2009) ? | User: I haven't seen either of those! | User: Which do you like best? | Recommender: 2012  (2009) is for sure a great apocalypse movie- kind of silly though. How about World War Z  with Brad Pitt? That's another great one! | User: I have seen World War Z. | User: I did enjoy that one very much. | Recommender: Nice! A good older one is Mad Max (1979) , or the newer one Mad Max: Fury Road (2015) . It's more of a post apocalyptic world, but both are very good. | User: I have seen that one. I will have to try 2012  (2009) | User: Thanks for the suggestions! | Recommender: Awesome! I'm sure you'll love it! | Recommender: Take care my friend. | User: You too!\nRecommender: hello! | Recommender: what kind of movies do you like? | User: Hello | User: I think I&quot;m in the mood for a good musical | Recommender: Do you like Audrey Hepburn? Funny Face (1957) is a great mid-century musical | User: Not sure having seen any of her movies. Might have to try that out | User: Grease  (1978) is one of my favorite musicals | Recommender: Definitely. Also, West Side Story  (1961) is another great one | User: I've heard that was a good movie | Recommender: would you like any more recommendations today? | User: I know this isn't really a musical, but how is the movie Pitch Perfect (2012) | Recommender: I have not seen it, it seems like it could be funny though. | User: Thank you for your help.\nRecommender: Hi how are you? | User: Hello | User: I'm good | Recommender: What kind of movie are you looking for? | User: I'm looking for a film similar to The Wolverine  (2013) | User: A superhero film with great action | Recommender: How about Justice League  (2017) ? | Recommender: That is a great one. | User: I enjoyed that one | User: good suggestion | User: I also like The Avengers  (2012) | Recommender: Me too It was great. | User: Any other suggestions? | Recommender: Oh yes that one was awesome. I and my kids loved it. | Recommender: Deadpool  (2016) | Recommender: Have you seen it? | Recommender: It was really good. | User: That is one of my favorites | User: It was great action and hilarious | Recommender: It was lol | Recommender: I loved it | Recommender: I hope that helps | Recommender: Have a great day\nRecommender: Hello | User: Hi | User: How are you? | Recommender: Great | User: Do you know of any good comedies? | Recommender: I do :) | User: Something like The Hangover (2009) | Recommender: How about Happy Gilmore (1996) | User: That one is my favorite all time movie | Recommender: Or maybe Love Stinks  (1999) | User: I loved that one too lol | User: It was funny | User: Haven't ever heard of that, but I will have to check it out | User: Sounds neat | Recommender: Of course an obvious one is The Hangover Part II (2011) | User: I haven't seen that one either. Ill check it out tonoight | Recommender: hope you enjoy the films | User: I bet its awesome | Recommender: have a great day | User: Thank you so much | Recommender: goodbye | User: bye\nUser: Hey there! | Recommender: Hi! Do you think most movies now a days are predictable and lack character depth and story depth? | User: Some of them yes. :)  Especially the ones the companies just remake or popout like it isn't anything. | Recommender: Yes. Did you like the new Star Wars: Episode VIII – The Last Jedi (2017) | User: Can you recommend any movies that have a good story line and are post apocalyptic like The Postman  (1997) and maybe The Girl with All the Gifts  (2016) ? | User: I did not. I am not a star-wars fan unfortunately. | Recommender: Hmm.. I have never heard of the The Postman  (1997). Thats okay. But Star Wars: Episode VIII – The Last Jedi (2017) was just a remake to make money. Have you seen The Hunger Games  (2012) ? | Recommender: What about The Book of Eli (2010) ? | User: I agree. Star Wars: Episode VIII – The Last Jedi (2017) was nothing but a money gimmick.  I didn't care for The Hunger Games  (2012)  but I loved The Book of Eli (2010) .  I should go back and watch it! | Recommender: I thought they were both okay. What about The Island  (2005)  with Ewan McGregor? That is sort of a  post apocalyptic movie. | User: I haven't seen that either! | User: I will have to check it out. :) | Recommender: Great. Have a good day.\nRecommender: Hey there! | User: Hello, I want to take the grandkids to the movies this weekend.  They are in middle school. | Recommender: Alright\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}], "parameters": {"model": "gpt-3.5-turbo", "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "temperature": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0}}}
