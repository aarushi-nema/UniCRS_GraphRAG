What about It  (2017) ? Seen it? | User: ya I did. loved it! respected the original is what i liked most about it. | Recommender: me too! the submit button is lit. should we submit? | User: ya cool talkin with you bro | Recommender: ;)\nRecommender: fanboy? | User: LMAO! Yeah I'm here. :) | Recommender: lol guess we're the only ones on this morning. sunday is a slow day for hits anyway | User: It is. So about those movies, Primal Fear  (1996) was good. Other than the villain winning what did you like? | Recommender: the whole story was good. i cant explain exactly. like the suspense of what was goin on kept me on edge. | User: I agree. I thought Eddie Norton's character was a real victim. Until the ending, lol. | User: In a way, it was almost like The Lincoln Lawyer  with Matthew Mcconoughy (however you spell it) | Recommender: never saw it. any good? | User: I thought so. It's not as gritty as Primal Fear  (1996) but it's got just an interesting of a story. | Recommender: gotcha | User: Have you seen @Red Dragon? With Eddie Norton and Anthony Hopkins? | Recommender: ya! got that on dvd too. ive got almost all of anthony hopkins films. he does crazy well. scares me lol | User: He does. I've seen most all his movies except for Hannibal Rising  (2007) . | Recommender: i dont think he was in that one tho. he was in @Hannibal for sure, but not rising. | User: Oh okay. Maybe that's why I've never seen it. | User: Was he in Manhunter  (1986) ? | Recommender: nah but thats the movie Red Dragon  (2002) is based on. | User: Is it? I didn't know that. | Recommender: yah. its an 80s flick. | Recommender: looks like were done again. maybe i;ll see you arond fanboy | User: lol Same here. Nice chatting with you.\nUser: Hi there! | Recommender: fanboy? | User: Dude! lol! | Recommender: lol! | User: You're not stalking me are you? Like in the movie Psycho  | Recommender: ha! nah bro. which one though? the older ones or the remake in like late 90s? | User: The older versions. I didn't see the remake. I was afraid it would suck. | Recommender: it does. | User: I've seen all the original except for Psycho III (1986) | Recommender: yah me too. never got around to watching the third one. second was okay. not as shocking like the first. nothing ever beats the original | User: What about Terminator 2: Judgment Day (1991) ? | Recommender: well that one yah but not many sequals surpass the original. | User: True true. Aliens  (1986) was another one. | Recommender: yah. too bad Prometheus  (2012) didnt follow suit | User: I liked Prometheus  (2012) . I thought it was a good film. | Recommender: your weird bro. but gotta go this hit is done. catch you later maybe | User: Yeah, maybe. :)\nRecommender: fanboy? | User: It's me. I'm Curtis by the way. :) | Recommender: alan. | User: So Alan, where were we? Sequels right? Since you didn't care much for Prometheus  (2012)  I'm guessing you also hated Alien: Covenant (2017) ... | Recommender: yah | Recommender: i tried to like it but it just went way off course. ridley scott is killing that franchise. | User: Think he's losing his touch? | Recommender: maybe. i think fox shold hand it over to someone else. speilberg would be good. | User: Yeah I agree. What he did with Jurassic Park  (1993) was sweet. | Recommender: yah. i was so fascinated by it when i first saw it. my dad said it reminded him of seeing Jaws  (1975) for the first time. | User: With the animatronics? | Recommender: yah. speilberg brings a level of realism not many other directors can touch. | User: True. Looks like we've met our quota. Let's continue this conversation in a bit. | Recommender: see ya!\nRecommender: Alan? | User: here man. | Recommender: :) | User: like i was saying, speilberg is the man! cameron too! Avatar  (2009) was lit! | Recommender: &quot;Lit&quot;? | User: pretty good lol | Recommender: I see. :) It was a great movie. Saw it in 3d and it blew me away. I haven't seen a 3d movie since that could compare. | User: same. i dont think they offer 3d movies much anymore. | Recommender: There are. But of course you don't care for superhero films. | User: i wont say that. just not a fan of them but i watched Avengers: Age of Ultron (2015) and i liked it. wasnt as cheesy\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>WISH UPON<|>MOVIE<|>A horror movie from 2017)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>IT (2017)<|>MOVIE<|>A 2017 movie)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>PRIMAL FEAR (1996)<|>MOVIE<|>A 1996 movie)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>EDDIE NORTON<|>ACTOR<|>Actor in Primal Fear (1996))\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>MATTHEW MCCONAUGHEY<|>ACTOR<|>Actor in The Lincoln Lawyer)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>RED DRAGON<|>MOVIE<|>A movie with Edward Norton and Anthony Hopkins)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ANTHONY HOPKINS<|>ACTOR<|>Actor in Red Dragon)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>HANNIBAL RISING (2007)<|>MOVIE<|>A movie from 2007)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>MANHUNTER (1986)<|>MOVIE<|>A movie from 1986)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>RED DRAGON (2002)<|>MOVIE<|>A movie from 2002)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>PSYCHO<|>MOVIE<|>A movie)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>PSYCHO III (1986)<|>MOVIE<|>A movie from 1986)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>TERMINATOR 2: JUDGMENT DAY (1991)<|>MOVIE<|>A movie from 1991)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ALIENS (1986)<|>MOVIE<|>A movie from 1986)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>PROMETHEUS (2012)<|>MOVIE<|>A movie from 2012)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ALIEN: COVENANT (2017)<|>MOVIE<|>A movie from 2017)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>RIDLEY SCOTT<|>DIRECTOR<|>Director of Alien: Covenant)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>STEVEN SPIELBERG<|>DIRECTOR<|>Director of Jurassic Park)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>JAWS (1975)<|>MOVIE<|>A movie from 1975)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>AVATAR (2009)<|>MOVIE<|>A movie from 2009)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>AVENGERS: AGE OF ULTRON (2015)<|>MOVIE<|>A movie from 2015)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>EDDIE NORTON<|>PRIMAL FEAR (1996)<|>Eddie Norton stars in Primal Fear)<|>\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>EDDIE NORTON<|>RED DRAGON<|>Eddie Norton stars in Red Dragon)<|>\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>ANTHONY HOPKINS<|>RED DRAGON<|>Anthony Hopkins stars in Red Dragon)<|>\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>STEVEN SPIELBERG<|>JURASSIC PARK<|>Steven Spielberg directed Jurassic Park)<|>\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>STEVEN SPIELBERG<|>JAWS (1975)<|>Steven Spielberg directed Jaws)<|>\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>STEVEN SPIELBERG<|>AVATAR (2009)<|>Steven Spielberg did not direct Avatar)<|>\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>STEVEN SPIELBERG<|>AVENGERS: AGE OF ULTRON (2015)<|>Steven Spielberg did not direct Avengers: Age of Ultron)<|>\n<|COMPLETE|>"}, {"content": "MANY entities and relationships were missed in the last extraction.
