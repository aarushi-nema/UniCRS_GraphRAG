I'll have to watch the movie. | Recommender: Yeah, I loved that book when I was a kid! I hope they make movies of the sequels. | User: That would be great! | User: Thank you for the suggestions! | Recommender: Another newer family film is Isle Of Dogs (2018). Have you seen that yet? | User: No, I haven't seen that one. | Recommender: Hope this helps you find what you're looking for. | User: It helps a lot. Thank you! | User: Have a great day! Bye\nRecommender: Hello. How are you today? | User: I'm good. How are you? | Recommender: Great! | Recommender: What kind of movies do you like? | User: Can you recommend any good family movies that tweens might like? | Recommender: A great one is The Princess Bride  (1987). Have you seen that? Also, High School Musical  is good too. | User: Those sound good. I don't think the kids have seen them yet. | User: They're nieces, not my kids. So it's not like I am a bad mom who doesn't know which movies her kids have seen. :) | Recommender: Have you seen Diary of a Wimpy Kid  (2010) or The Karate Kid  (2010)? Those are both great! | User: I saw the original The Karate Kid (1984) with Ralph Macchio, but not the new one. Haven't seen Wimpy kid. But they're good suggestions. | Recommender: Another good idea is Beauty and the Beast  (2017). This is the live action, not a cartoon so they might like it. | User: I think they saw that one already.
