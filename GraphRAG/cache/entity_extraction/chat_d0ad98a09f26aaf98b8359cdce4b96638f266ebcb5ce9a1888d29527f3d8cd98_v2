Yes, right now I'm into coming of age movies. | Recommender: I would recommend movies like The Breakfast Club (1985) or Stand by Me  (1986) then. | Recommender: If you are looking for something a bit more unorthodox Zombieland (2009) might work. | User: I've seen The Breakfast Club (1985) but not Stand by Me  (1986). I'll look it up. | User: What is Zombieland (2009) about? | Recommender: Zombieland (2009) is a zombie movie, but it focuses on a kid that is learning to survive on his own. Then meets a girl and develops as an individual. | User: That sounds like a unique twist on the theme. | Recommender: I could also recommend Turbo Kid (2015) for another odd coming of age movie. | User: What happens in Turbo Kid (2015)? | User: I'm really excited to check out these movies. | Recommender: In this movie, a kid is in a post apocalyptic world and again meets a girl. I would tell you more, but I would hate to spoil this one. It is a gem. | User: I'm putting it to the top of my to watch list, that sounds really good. | Recommender: I'm glad I was able to give you some new suggestions! Hope you enjoy them. | User: Yes, thanks so much! have a good night. :)\nRecommender: Hello! Do you have any movie preferences? | User: Hey, can you recommend me any movies that have animals? any animal or type of movie will do. | Recommender: Zootopia is a recent animated animal movie. | Recommender: Alternatively, We Bought a Zoo and Secondhand Lions (2003) are both charming. | Recommender: If you prefer something more serious, March of the Penguins (2005) is ideal. | User: I haven't seen Zootopia. I heard it was a little darker than most disney films? | User: I haven't seen We Bought a Zoo or Secondhand Lions (2003). March of the Penguins (2005) was good, but pretty heavy. | Recommender: Well, if you truly look at Disney movies, most have a dark scene in them. The Little Mermaid  (1989) for example involves a witch stealing the main character's voice and dooming the king. | Recommender: My favorite movie involves animals actually. The Secret of NIMH. | User: Thats true, The Little Mermaid  (1989) definitely had some dark scenes. | User: The Secret of NIMH was very good. | Recommender: The Lion King (1994) had many as well. I believe Disney is trying to prepare children for harsh realities. Though, it does surprise many. | User: Thanks for the suggestions, I'm going to watch Zootopia first. | Recommender: I hope you enjoy it! Take care! | User: I agree, the scene with simba and his dad dying was really heavy, but a classic. | User: Thanks so much. :)\nRecommender: Good morning! What can I recommend for you today | User: hello how are you | User: umm something scary please | Recommender: Okay. What about It  (2017) ? | User: saw it im more of a fan of the original It (1990) | Recommender: I am not a fan of clowns LOL | Recommender: Have you seen A Quiet Place to Kill (1970)  I heard that is pretty scary | User: that one is also very great | Recommender: Ooops, I meant A Quiet Place (2018) | User: lol its ok also a ggod movie | Recommender: There is also The Conjuring 2 (2016) | User: that is amazing to me too | Recommender: I hope I was able to help | User: thank you so much these are great choces have a great day | Recommender: You're welcome. Have a good week\nRecommender: hi how are you? | Recommender: Are you looking for a good movie today? | User: im good how are you today | Recommender: what genre are you interested in seeing? | User: umm im looking for a thriller | User: like Taken  (2008) or Scream  (1996) | Recommender: great, love those movies. Have you seen the Halloween  (2007) and Halloween II  (2009) series from Rob Zombie? | Recommender: great visuals and storytelling. | Recommender: these are the remakes | Recommender: I also like the Saw  (2004) series | User: i love them but the originals are way better | User: that is a great series too | Recommender: yes the classics usually are better | User: i think i may rewatch it | Recommender: I think you will enjoy it | User: thank you for your help | Recommender: Let me know if you need more help | User: have a great week | Recommender: thanks, have a good one\nRecommender: hello, hows it going! | Recommender: are you looking to find a good movie to watch? | Recommender: are you interested in action/adventure movies? | Recommender: or what genre do you like? | User: yeah one like Star Wars  (1977) | User: how are you | User: i love the whole series | Recomm\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}], "parameters": {"model": "gpt-3.5-turbo", "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "temperature": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0}}}
