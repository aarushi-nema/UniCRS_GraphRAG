But I'll check out Four Weddings and a Funeral (1994). Thanks for the tip. | Recommender: You're welcome! I hope you enjoy it as much as I did. | Recommender: And if you're ever looking for another great romantic comedy, I also suggest Silver Linings Playbook (2012) . | User: I loved Bradley Cooper in American Hustle (2013) | Recommender: If you loved in in that, you'll definitely love him Silver Linings Playbook (2012) .

You seen it? | User: Step Brothers  (2008) is one of my all-time favorites. Very funny movie. | Recommender: What about Talladega Nights: The Ballad of Ricky Bobby (2006) | User: Talladega Nights: The Ballad of Ricky Bobby (2006) is also excellent. John C. Reilly and Will Ferrell are a great comedic duo. | Recommender: John C. Reilly is a genius. Don't know if you like musicals, but he was awesome in Chicago  (2002) | User: I never saw Chicago  (2002). I should add that to my watchlist. | Recommender: Ocean's 8 (2018) will be out in a few weeks.
