Is it kind of like that? | User: He is an excellent actor. | Recommender: It's different. It has a lot of fighting action. But Tom Cruise's character gets taken prisoner by the Samurai (takes place in the 1800's) and he learns their beautiful culture and learns to respect them. | Recommender: It is so good and the cinematography is beautiful. | User: That sounds pretty cool. I can appreciate good cinematography. I will definitely check that one out. | Recommender: Another good one is The Fugitive  (1993) with Harrison Ford. | Recommender: That has a lot of action and is almost a thriller.

(1986) with Steve Martin and Chevy Chase? | User: I have not, I love Steve Martin in Planes, Trains and Automobiles (1986) though! | Recommender: Oh gosh.
