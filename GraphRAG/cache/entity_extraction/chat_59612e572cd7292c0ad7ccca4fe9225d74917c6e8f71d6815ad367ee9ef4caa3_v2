The Shape of Water  (2017) I havent seen that yett | User: It's really good. It's a drama and I believe it is up for some awards but it also has a science fiction aspect. Really good movie overall. I watched Thor: Ragnarok (2017) too. Loved it. | User: Thank you for your help.\nRecommender: Hello. I hope you are doing well today. Is there any specific genre you are interested in? | User: HI can you suggest a good movie in that is action packed? | Recommender: Action packed movies.. Have you seen The Bourne Ultimatum  (2007) ? | User: I haven't seen that movie.  Is it a good one? | Recommender: I enjoyed it. It has a lot of action and a complex storyline. There are other movies before it though. It's a series starting with The Bourne Identity  (2002) I think. | Recommender: This movie is a bit older but it has lots of action in Repo Men (2010) | User: I have seen Bourne Identity and it was good. | Recommender: You will probably like the following movies then. I like the ones featuring Jeremy Renner better than the series with Matt Damon. Have you ever watched Looper  (2012) ? | Recommender: I absolutely loved that movie. | User: Have you seen Jumanji  (2017)? | User: I watched it this week at the theater and it was great. | Recommender: No. I haven't caught that one yet. | Recommender: I will look into it. I haven't been to the theater in a while. | User: I haven't seen Looper yet either. | User: This was the first movie I seen in a while at the the theater. | User: Justice League  (2017) was a really good movie too.  Have you seen it by chance? | Recommender: Going to the theater is expensive, especially with a family. The last movie we saw in the theater was Thor: Ragnarok (2017) | Recommender: Yes. I love the comic based movies | Recommender: I thought about recommending movies like Suicide Squad  (2016) but most people already know them. | User: Those are my families favorite.  Yes it is very expensive. | Recommender: My family too. They are what we watch together. | User: I love Suicide Squad. | User: I am looking forward to Black Panther (2018) | Recommender: I am too. We will be going to the theater to see it. We try not to miss any marvel movies when they come out. We were hooked after The Avengers  (2012) | User: That was a good one to watch.  We have all marvel movies out of dvd. | Recommender: That is a good plan. | Recommender: I hope you enjoy your weekend and catch some good movies.\nUser: Hi! Do you know any great scary movies like Poltergeist  (1982)? | Recommender: Im not really into scary movies, but i have watched Freddy vs. Jason (2003) I think is a good movie | User: I'm not really into those versus movies. I've seen it but didn't like it too much. | User: Haunted House  (2004) was another that I enjoyed. | Recommender: Yeah i enjoyed it to. | Recommender: Im more into cartoon movies like Sing  (2016)\nRecommender: hey | User: Hello! | Recommender: hope your day is going well! What type of films do you like? | User: Have you watched the new movie Jumanji  (2017) yet? | User: My day is going ok.  Hope you are having a good day. | Recommender: Not yet! were you a fan? If  so I think Anaconda  (1997) and Deep Blue Sea  (1999) are semi similar films that are worth checking out | User: Yes my family really liked it.  I have seen all of those and they was good too. | Recommender: King Kong  (2005) is also sort of in the same realm | User: Have you seen Suicide Squad  (2016)  or The Avengers  (2012)?  They was all good marvel movies. | User: My husband was into King Kong but me not so much. | Recommender: The The Avengers  (2012) I have, and loved it! Really fun film! I'd also recommend Snakes on a Plane (2006) if your family liked Jumanji  (2017) so much | User: Snakes on a Plane was ok.  I am looking forward to Black Panther (2018).   you should check it out. | Recommender: I hope my suggestions were helpful, ma'am! have a good rest of the day and super bowl weekend :) and yes definitely seeing Black Panther (2018) . That was my favorite character from Captain America: Civil War (2016) | User: Hope you have a great weekend and Thank you for the movies suggestions. | Recommender: anytime! all the best! | User: Same to you :)\nRecommender: hey there | User: Hey! | User: Can you recommend me a funny movie? | Recommender: Sure. comedies are my favorite | Recommender: Who's your favorite comedic actor or actress? | User: I like Charlie Kelly a lot, as well as Channing Tatum | User: Jennifer Anniston is really funny\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}], "parameters": {"model": "gpt-3.5-turbo", "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "temperature": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0}}}
