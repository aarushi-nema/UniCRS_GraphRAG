I recently saw Love, Simon (2018), it was great. Do you know any movies like that? | User: I also like fantasy  movies. | Recommender: Oh, someone just recommended Love, Simon (2018) .  I want to see that. | Recommender: I've also heard Call Me by Your Name  (2017) is good | User: Yes, it was amazing. I really liked how funny it was and it felt like you were right along side him. | User: I Haven't seen Call Me by Your Name  (2017) but it also looks very good. | Recommender: I don't know if it is similar, but A Home at the End of the World  (2004) was pretty good as well | User: What is that about? | Recommender: As I recall it was about growing up and dealing with trauma | User: That sounds similar, I'll check it out. | Recommender: I'm trying to think about fantasy films, but all I can think of right now is the new Jumanji  (2017) film | User: Was that good? | Recommender: It was entertaining, but nothing close to the original | Recommender: I expected it to be much worse | User: I loved the original. I think I'll check out the sequel, but nothing can hold a candle. | User: Thanks for your help. | Recommender: You're welcome | Recommender: I also saw the new one Ready Player One  (2018) | Recommender: Had a lot of good '80s references and VR fantasy | User: That does look very good, I'll add that to my list too.

I like Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire  (2005) and Les MisÃ©rables  (2012). | User: Any good suggestions? | Recommender: Sure! A couple good ones are The Dark Tower  (2017) based off of the Stephen King book. It's kind of a sci fi western sort of thing. | User: I've heard of it. Who was in it? | User: That sounds really good. | Recommender: The main characters are Idris Elba and Matthew McConnaughey. | User: Okay. Those two are great. I'll have to watch it. It sounds kind of different from Stephen King's normal stuff. | User: Any other suggestions? | Recommender: It is! Yes, another good one is Lemony Snicket's A Series of Unfortunate Events (2004) ! | Recommender: It's much better than the current TV show. It only covers the first three books though. | User: I have seen that one. It is so weird and quirky. I loved it. | User: That is kind of my thing. | Recommender: I am sure you'd love it if you are a fan of fantasy and fun characters! | User: Yes.

I loved that one | User: I haven't seen that my friends from school always joke about a scene from it. It's about bowling I think right? | Recommender: Bowling is certainly in it but it's about a lazy scuffed looking kind of guy who is just kind of &quot;the dude&quot; and the movie progresses from there | User: Sounds like me. I will check it out. | Recommender: Haha! Also check out Hot Fuzz (2007) I really liked that British film | User: I have never heard of that one. | Recommender: It's definitely something different | Recommender: And have you seen the great classic Fight Club (1999) ? | Recommender: Brad Pitt is in it | User: That movie really was something, I couldn't understand what it was. | User: I felt crazy after watching it. | User: He was like talking to himself in the whole movie, the plot twist was so neat. | Recommender: And then check out the classic Dr. Strangelove (1964) | Recommender: Definitely fits the bill of\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>PIXAR FILMS<|>MOVIE<|>A collection of animated movies known for their creativity and innovation)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>EPIC (2013)<|>MOVIE<|>A 2013 animated fantasy movie featuring fairies)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>TROLLS (2016)<|>MOVIE<|>A 2016 animated movie that the user did not enjoy)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>LOVE, SIMON (2018)<|>MOVIE<|>A 2018 romantic drama movie that the user enjoyed)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CALL ME BY YOUR NAME (2017)<|>MOVIE<|>A 2017 romantic drama movie that the user found amazing)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>A HOME AT THE END OF THE WORLD (2004)<|>MOVIE<|>A 2004 drama movie about growing up and dealing with trauma)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>JUMANJI (2017)<|>MOVIE<|>A 2017 fantasy adventure movie, a sequel to the original)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>READY PLAYER ONE (2018)<|>MOVIE<|>A 2018 sci-fi movie with '80s references and VR fantasy elements)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>HARRY POTTER AND THE GOBLET OF FIRE (2005)<|>MOVIE<|>A 2005 fantasy movie based on the book)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>LES MISÃ‰RABLES (2012)<|>MOVIE<|>A 2012 musical drama movie based on the book)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>THE DARK TOWER (2017)<|>MOVIE<|>A 2017 sci-fi western movie based on the Stephen King book)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>IDRIS ELBA<|>ACTOR<|>One of the main actors in The Dark Tower (2017))\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>MATTHEW MCCONNAUGHEY<|>ACTOR<|>One of the main actors in The Dark Tower (2017))\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>LEMONY SNICKET'S A SERIES OF UNFORTUNATE EVENTS (2004)<|>MOVIE<|>A 2004 fantasy movie based on the book series)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>BAD SANTA (2003)<|>MOVIE<|>A 2003 black comedy movie that the user liked)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>THE BIG LEBOWSKI<|>MOVIE<|>A movie that features bowling and a lazy character known as \"the dude\")\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>HOT FUZZ (2007)<|>MOVIE<|>A 2007 British dark comedy movie recommended by the recommender)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>FIGHT CLUB (1999)<|>MOVIE<|>A 1999 movie with a complex plot and a memorable twist, featuring Brad Pitt)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>DR.
