Cube  (1997) holds up today. | User: I did see The Conjuring (2013) during the daytime.  Cube  (1997) was really interesting. | User: i was surprised it wasn't boring given the premise | User: Thank you for the suggestions | Recommender: Well, I have Little Shop of Horrors  (1986) stuck in my head now!

But love The Shining  (1980)  and Alien  (1979) | Recommender: Are you looking for any particular type, such as psycho killer or monster movie? | Recommender: Ghosts would be another genre of it. | User: either one is fine | User: No ghosts...that's too scary | Recommender: Lol, fair enough. | Recommender: Hostel  (2011) if you want something that is gory and quite scary. | User: Oh that was one I wanted to see.

Have you seen Earth to Echo (2014) or Mac and Me (1988) ? | Recommender: I thought both of those were pretty good. | User: Oh, I have not seen those | User: Was Earth to Echo (2014) with the little white robot? | User: I think I saw the DVD cover | Recommender: Yes!

I'm actually trying to find another series like it! any recommendations? | User: Well, The Princess Bride  (1987) is obvious, but have you seen Stardust  (2007)? | User: Also, happily Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them  (2016) is getting a sequel, I believe. | Recommender: I loved The princess Bride! It reminds me of Robin Hood: Men in Tights (1993) | User: Ah, a classic. Mel Brooks is a national treasure. | Recommender: I haven't seen those movies! I'll have to check them out | User: Oh, most definitely.
