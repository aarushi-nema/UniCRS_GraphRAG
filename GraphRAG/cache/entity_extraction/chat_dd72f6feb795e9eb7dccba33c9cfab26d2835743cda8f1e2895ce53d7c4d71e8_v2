My wife loves it! | Recommender: Okay, what about Collateral Beauty (2016)  with Will Smith? | User: No I haven't seen that. Isn't it about death? | Recommender: Sort of. It's about life in general and overcoming the hardships that go along with it. | Recommender: I would also recommend Reign Over Me (2007) with Don Cheadle and Adam Sandler. | User: What's that about? | Recommender: About a guy (Sandler) who loses his famly on 9/11 and goes into a deep depression/withdrawal. The movie is about how he tries to cope with the loss afterward. | User: Sounds sad. | User: lol | Recommender: I is, but you'll love it. | Recommender: Another good one is Seven Pounds (2008) also starring Will Smith. It's about attonment and forgiveness. | User: I see. These sound like good choices. I'll check them out, thanks! | Recommender: Welcome!\nUser: Hi friend! Can you recommend some goo sci-fi films? | Recommender: Let's see. What sub-genre? Fantasy or more space exploration? Creature feature? | User: Anything you think might have good philosophical or psychological assumptions weaved in. | Recommender: Hmmm.....I would have to suggest Cloverfield (2008) . Not too heave on the philosophy, but it does make you wonder about the backstory of it all. | User: Is that the one by JJ Abrams? | Recommender: Yes. | User: I've heard about that. Heard it was terrible. | Recommender: no, it's pretty good if you take it for what it is and don't compare it to other films. | Recommender: There's also 2 sequesl 10 Cloverfield Lane (2016) and The Cloverfield Paradox (2018) . | Recommender: The latter is only on Netflix for now. | Recommender: Also, similar to those is Life  (2017) . Honestly, if it weren't for the difference in the monster's appearance, you could say Life  (2017)  takes place in the cloververse. | User: Interesting. I've never seen any of these. Will make for an interesting evening. Thanks! :D | Recommender: Welcome!\nRecommender: Hi there! | User: Good afternoon! | User: I'm looking for a good comedy, any ideas? | User: I really like Bridesmaids  (2011) and Wedding Crashers (2005) | Recommender: I see. | Recommender: Is something like Bad Moms (2016) not your taste? | User: Oh yeah, I saw that.  It was pretty good | Recommender: Okay then. What about Talladega Nights: The Ballad of Ricky Bobby (2006) ? I love it, but some of my friends don't care for it. | User: Oh of course, thats a classic! | Recommender: I'll watch anything with Will Ferrell. Speaking of, have you seen The House  (2017) ? | User: Wow, who doesn't like Rickie Bobbie? | User: I have not! | Recommender: Believe, I know a few who say they couldn't stand the movie. | User: Ok!  I think we're all set!  Thanks for your time and take care! | Recommender: You too!\nUser: Hi there! | User: I'm in the mood for a good 80s comedic horror. | Recommender: Hmm..weird request but I think I have an idea. | Recommender: There's Gremlins (1984) and Gremlins 2: The New Batch (1990)  to start | Recommender: The first is more horror and the second more comedy, but both are enjoyable. | User: I've seen those. I like to dark tone of the first better. The second was too silly for me. | Recommender: I happen to agree with you there. | Recommender: Then what about Critters  (1986) ? | User: I've not seen that. | Recommender: WHAT!?!? With the little furballs that eat people!? | User: Flesh-eating hairballs? Pass, lol | Recommender: No they aren't hairballs per se, but these furry &quot;critters&quot; that are highly aggressive and carnivourous. It's hilarious. You might like it. | User: I think I'll pass, lol | Recommender: Okay, what about...... The Thing  (1982) ? | User: I think I've seen that. About the Swedes being killed by the thing from the ice? | Recommender: Yes. | Recommender: There's a prequel also. Very good. | User: I thought that was a remake? | Recommender: No. It tells the story of the Norwegians that were killed at the other camp, and why they blew up the space ship. Came out in 2013 i think. | User: Sonds good. Thanks for the suggestions friend!\nUser: Hi there! | User: I'm in the mood for a good drama. | Recommender: I see. Define &quot;good drama&quot;? | User: I dunno, lol. Something that makes you sit and think. Something about more than mindless killing or fight scenes. | Recommender: Gotcha. | Recommender: What about Postcards from the Edge  (1990) ? | Recommender: Or 28 Days  (2000) ? |\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}], "parameters": {"model": "gpt-3.5-turbo", "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "temperature": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0}}}
