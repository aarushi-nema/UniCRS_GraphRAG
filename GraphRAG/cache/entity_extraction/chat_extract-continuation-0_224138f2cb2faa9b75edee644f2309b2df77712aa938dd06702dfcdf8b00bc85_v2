I mean it has Thor in it but you should watch the individual films first but those are not too action packed | User: Should I watch Thor  before Justice League  (2017)? | Recommender: Hopefully I am helping lol | User: Yes, this is really helpful. | Recommender: Thor before The Avengers  (2012) | Recommender: THE other is a dc movie | User: Okay, so Thor, then Avengers? | Recommender: Yes you will love them | User: Thanks for suggesting some good movies, I'm really excited to check them out. | Recommender: Okay have a great night | User: You too! :)\nRecommender: Hello, are you interested in any particular type of movie? | User: Hi. Yes, right now I'm into coming of age movies. | Recommender: I would recommend movies like The Breakfast Club (1985) or Stand by Me  (1986) then. | Recommender: If you are looking for something a bit more unorthodox Zombieland (2009) might work. | User: I've seen The Breakfast Club (1985) but not Stand by Me  (1986). I'll look it up. | User: What is Zombieland (2009) about? | Recommender: Zombieland (2009) is a zombie movie, but it focuses on a kid that is learning to survive on his own. Then meets a girl and develops as an individual. | User: That sounds like a unique twist on the theme. | Recommender: I could also recommend Turbo Kid (2015) for another odd coming of age movie. | User: What happens in Turbo Kid (2015)? | User: I'm really excited to check out these movies. | Recommender: In this movie, a kid is in a post apocalyptic world and again meets a girl. I would tell you more, but I would hate to spoil this one. It is a gem. | User: I'm putting it to the top of my to watch list, that sounds really good. | Recommender: I'm glad I was able to give you some new suggestions! Hope you enjoy them. | User: Yes, thanks so much! have a good night. :)\nRecommender: Hello! Do you have any movie preferences? | User: Hey, can you recommend me any movies that have animals? any animal or type of movie will do. | Recommender: Zootopia is a recent animated animal movie. | Recommender: Alternatively, We Bought a Zoo and Secondhand Lions (2003) are both charming. | Recommender: If you prefer something more serious, March of the Penguins (2005) is ideal. | User: I haven't seen Zootopia. I heard it was a little darker than most disney films? | User: I haven't seen We Bought a Zoo or Secondhand Lions (2003). March of the Penguins (2005) was good, but pretty heavy. | Recommender: Well, if you truly look at Disney movies, most have a dark scene in them. The Little Mermaid  (1989) for example involves a witch stealing the main character's voice and dooming the king. | Recommender: My favorite movie involves animals actually. The Secret of NIMH. | User: Thats true, The Little Mermaid  (1989) definitely had some dark scenes. | User: The Secret of NIMH was very good. | Recommender: The Lion King (1994) had many as well. I believe Disney is trying to prepare children for harsh realities. Though, it does surprise many. | User: Thanks for the suggestions, I'm going to watch Zootopia first. | Recommender: I hope you enjoy it! Take care! | User: I agree, the scene with simba and his dad dying was really heavy, but a classic. | User: Thanks so much. :)\nRecommender: Good morning! What can I recommend for you today | User: hello how are you | User: umm something scary please | Recommender: Okay. What about It  (2017) ? | User: saw it im more of a fan of the original It (1990) | Recommender: I am not a fan of clowns LOL | Recommender: Have you seen A Quiet Place to Kill (1970)  I heard that is pretty scary | User: that one is also very great | Recommender: Ooops, I meant A Quiet Place (2018) | User: lol its ok also a ggod movie | Recommender: There is also The Conjuring 2 (2016) | User: that is amazing to me too | Recommender: I hope I was able to help | User: thank you so much these are great choces have a great day | Recommender: You're welcome. Have a good week\nRecommender: hi how are you? | Recommender: Are you looking for a good movie today? | User: im good how are you today | Recommender: what genre are you interested in seeing? | User: umm im looking for a thriller | User: like Taken  (2008) or Scream  (1996) | Recommender: great, love those movies. Have you seen the Halloween  (2007) and Halloween II  (2009) series from Rob Zombie? | Recommender: great visuals and storytelling. | Recommender: these are the remakes | Recommender: I also like the Saw  (2004) series | User: i love them but the originals are way better | User: that is a great series too | Recommender: yes the\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>JUSTICE LEAGUE (2017)<|>MOVIE<|>A 2017 superhero movie featuring Thor)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>THOR<|>ACTOR<|>Character in Justice League (2017))\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>THOR<|>MOVIE<|>A character in Justice League (2017))\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>AVENGERS (2012)<|>MOVIE<|>A 2012 superhero movie)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>COMING OF AGE<|>GENRE<|>Genre of movies focusing on the transition from childhood to adulthood)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>THE BREAKFAST CLUB (1985)<|>MOVIE<|>A 1985 coming of age movie)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>STAND BY ME (1986)<|>MOVIE<|>A 1986 coming of age movie)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ZOMBIELAND (2009)<|>MOVIE<|>A 2009 zombie movie with a unique twist)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>TURBO KID (2015)<|>MOVIE<|>A 2015 post-apocalyptic coming of age movie)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ZOOTOPIA<|>MOVIE<|>A recent animated animal movie)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>WE BOUGHT A ZOO<|>MOVIE<|>A charming movie involving animals)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SECONDHAND LIONS (2003)<|>MOVIE<|>A charming movie involving animals)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>MARCH OF THE PENGUINS (2005)<|>MOVIE<|>A serious documentary about penguins)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>THE LITTLE MERMAID (1989)<|>MOVIE<|>A 1989 Disney movie with dark elements)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>THE SECRET OF NIMH<|>MOVIE<|>A movie involving animals)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>THE LION KING (1994)<|>MOVIE<|>A 1994 Disney movie with dark scenes)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>IT (2017)<|>MOVIE<|>A 2017 horror movie)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>IT (1990)<|>MOVIE<|>The original 1990 horror movie)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>A QUIET PLACE (2018)<|>MOVIE<|>A 2018 horror movie)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>A QUIET PLACE TO KILL (1970)<|>MOVIE<|>A 1970 horror movie)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>THE CONJURING 2 (2016)<|>MOVIE<|>A 2016 horror movie)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>TAKEN (2008)<|>MOVIE<|>A 2008 thriller movie)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SCREAM (1996)<|>MOVIE<|>A 1996 thriller movie)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>HALLOWEEN (2007)<|>MOVIE<|>A 2007 horror movie)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>HALLOWEEN II (2009)<|>MOVIE<|>A 2009 horror movie)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SAW (2004)<|>MOVIE<|>A 2004 horror movie)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>THOR<|>JUSTICE LEAGUE (2017)<|>Thor is a character in Justice League)<|>\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>THOR<|>JUSTICE LEAGUE (2017)<|>Thor is an actor in Justice League)<|>\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>THOR<|>AVENGERS (2012)<|>Thor is a character in Avengers)<|>\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>THE BREAKFAST CLUB (1985)<|>COMING OF AGE<|>The Breakfast Club is a coming of age movie)<|>\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>STAND BY ME (1986)<|>COMING OF AGE<|>Stand by Me is a coming of age movie)<|>\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>ZOMBIELAND (2009)<|>COMING OF AGE<|>Zombieland is a coming of age movie with a unique twist)<|>\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>TURBO KID (2015)<|>COMING OF AGE<|>Turbo Kid is a post-apocalyptic coming of age movie)<|>\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>ZOOTOPIA<|>ANIMAL<|>Zootopia is an animated animal movie)<|>\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>WE BOUGHT A ZOO<|>ANIMAL<|>We Bought a Zoo is a movie involving animals)<|>\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>SECONDHAND LIONS (2003)<|>ANIMAL<|>Secondhand Lions is a movie involving animals)<|>\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>MARCH OF THE PENGUINS (2005)<|>ANIMAL<|>March of the Penguins is a documentary about penguins)<|>\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>THE LITTLE MERMAID (1989)<|>DARK<|>The Little Mermaid has dark elements)<|>\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>THE SECRET OF NIMH<|>ANIMAL<|>The Secret of NIMH is a movie involving animals)<|>\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>THE LION KING (1994)<|>DARK<|>The Lion King has dark scenes)<|>\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>IT (2017)<|>HORROR<|>It (2017) is a horror movie)<|>\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>IT (1990)<|>HORROR<|>It (1990) is a horror movie)<|>\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>A QUIET PLACE (2018)<|>HORROR<|>A Quiet Place (2018) is a horror movie)<|>\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>A QUIET PLACE TO KILL (1970)<|>HORROR<|>A Quiet Place to Kill (1970) is a horror movie)<|>\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>THE CONJURING 2 (2016)<|>HORROR<|>The Conjuring 2 (2016) is a horror movie)<|>\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>TAKEN (2008)<|>THRILLER<|>Taken (2008) is a thriller movie)<|>\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>SCREAM (1996)<|>THRILLER<|>Scream (1996) is a thriller movie)<|>\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>HALLOWEEN (2007)<|>HORROR<|>Halloween (2007) is a horror movie)<|>\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>HALLOWEEN II (2009)<|>HORROR<|>Halloween II (2009) is a horror movie)<|>\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>SAW (2004)<|>HORROR<|>Saw (2004) is a horror movie)<|>\n<|COMPLETE|>"}, {"content": "MANY entities and relationships were missed in the last extraction.
