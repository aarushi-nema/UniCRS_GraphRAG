How about Monsters, Inc. (2001) thats a great kid friendly movie | User: I haven't seen that one, is it a series? | Recommender: there are two of them... Monsters University (2013) | User: great, I think those will work well | Recommender: they are both great films. Good for kids and has a few references that adults will appreciate | User: Thanks for all your help\nRecommender: Hello. How is your night going? | Recommender: Do you have anything in mind you would like to get suggestions for? | User: Hi I'm looking for a sports movie | Recommender: The first one that comes to mind is The Blind Side  (2009)  but I'm not sure if that is what you mean | Recommender: The Longest Yard  (2005)  came to mind as well but I don't think that is actually a sports movie. One second while I think of some others. | User: I have seen both of those, but I want something a bit more focused on the game. | Recommender: That's what I figured. I'm not sure if I have ever actually watched a movie focused on the game itself. Is Chariots of Fire (1981)  along the lines of what you're thinking of? | User: I' haven't seen it, but maybe | Recommender: I've never watched Blue Chips (1994)  but some actual NBA athletes play themselves in the movie so it might be something you would like. | User: I've seen it, the basketball is not a good as you would think. | User: The Greatest Game Ever Played (2005) was good | Recommender: I've heard of that but haven't watched. The only other movie I can come up with is The Natural  (1984) . I'm sorry I can't give better suggestions. I'm just not familiar with the subject. All I can think of are movies using sports as part of a larger plot. | User: that is a great suggestion, thanks for your help!\nRecommender: Hi are you looking for a movie? | User: i am looking for  amovie | User: One about dogs | Recommender: Have you seen Homeward Bound  (1923) | Recommender: Marley & Me  (2008) is a bit more modern | User: I like Marley & Me  (2008) was a heart warming movie | User: oh god. Homeward Bound  (1923) is a classsic | User: oldy but goldy | User: LOL | Recommender: Have you seen A Dog's Purpose  (2017) | User: No i havent actually. Have you seen Turner & Hooch (1989) with tom hanks? | User: Tom hanks is a great actor | User: love practially every movie hesbeen in | Recommender: Far from Home  (1989) is one I liked when I was kid | Recommender: I have it is a good one | Recommender: The Shaggy Dog  (2006) is cute for a family movie | User: I agree. Doesnt it have tim allen in it? | User: hes not in a lot of movies any more.. | Recommender: yup, it does. He had a real run of Disney movies | User: I might watch that tonight! | User: thanks a lot! | Recommender: no problem\nUser: HI | Recommender: Hello. | Recommender: Do you have something in mind you would like suggestions for? | User: I'm looking for a sports documentary | Recommender: Have you ever seen Murderball  (2005) ? I watched it in a college class concerning people with disabilities and I thought it was great. | User: I have seen it I liked it. I just watched Senna  (2010) i think something like that would be good | Recommender: Kicking and Screaming  (1995)  is a BBC documentary. I only watched part of it but it seemed interesting. | User: I haven't seen it what is it about? | Recommender: English football and some history concerning how the sport has evolved | User: That sounds good, i don't know much about soccer | Recommender: Have you ever seen Tyson  (1995) ? I'm not sure that is what you're looking for as it focuses mainly on one person but it was a good movie. | User: I did see that, I didn't love it. | User: Thanks for you help! bye\nUser: Hi | Recommender: Hello. | Recommender: What genre are you interested in? | User: I'm looking for a funny romantic movie | Recommender: It shouldn't be too hard to come up with those. There are lots of movies in that category. Have you seen Fool's Gold  (2008) ? | User: I have it was ok | Recommender: Maid in Manhattan  was a fun movie. Notting Hill   was decent and Julia Roberts starred. | User: I love both of those, something along those lines would be great | Recommender: What do you think of Bridget Jones's Diary  (2001) ? | User: No, is it good? | User: who is in it? | User: Any other suggestions? | Recommender: I liked it. it sort of reminded me of historical romances, although it is set in modern times. Another one that really is more of a historical romance is Just Visiting  (2001) | Recommender: I'll have to think a minute of the actresses name. | Recommender: Renee Zellweger\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}], "parameters": {"model": "gpt-3.5-turbo", "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "temperature": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0}}}
