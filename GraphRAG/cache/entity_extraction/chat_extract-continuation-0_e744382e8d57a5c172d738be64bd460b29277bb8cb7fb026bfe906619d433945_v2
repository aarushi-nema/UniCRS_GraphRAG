Have a great day. Bye!\nUser: Good morning! | Recommender: Hi! What type of movies do you prefer&gt; | User: I'm looking for something scary.  Blood and gore is okay, but I'd rather have a good story than a good slasher film. | Recommender: Ok. Hmm. This is a bit difficult for me. I could suggest Mother! (2017) although I did not like it. | User: Mother! (2017) looked good, what did you not like about it? | Recommender: Very disjointed in a way that I found boring. I was wondering if my younger self would have found it profound. However, I can always throw back to The Shining  (1980). Or Psycho  (1960) | Recommender: I am not that old. | User: Ohh....those are good ones.  I'm watching The Purge: Anarchy (2014) right now and it's horrible. | Recommender: A bad movie can be fun. And a good documentary like Blackfish  (2013)  can be frightening. | User: I'll definitely check that one out! | Recommender: How about The Blair Bitch Project (1999) ? Did you see that? Sadly, I din't think the creators went on to much success with other films. | Recommender: Yikes. The drop down menu has that misspelled! | User: Ehh....I lived in a small town when The Blair Witch Project (1999) came out and by the time it made it to our theater I'd already seen all the parodies of it.  And it was in a theater full of people who screamed and freaked out.  I think If I'd seen it earlier then I'd have liked it. | User: LOL | Recommender: That's an interesting timeline. I had never thought of the time effect. Should we say good-bye? | User: I wasn't really a fan of Paranormal Activity (2007) either.  Yes, I think so.  This is my first time doing these, so I'm still learning the process. | Recommender: Me too. I am very jet lagged from returning from a vacation in Asia so my thinking skills might be a bit impaired. | User: Well, it was nice talking to you.  Get some rest and have a good day. | Recommender: You were a lot of fun and made my tired brain think! Have a great day! Bye!\nUser: hello! | Recommender: Hi! | Recommender: How are you? | User: Do you have any good kids movies? | Recommender: I think I do.  How old are the kids in question? | User: My twins are 5 and my youngest is almost 3 | Recommender: Boys, girls, mixture? | User: All girls but they are not picky. They love Batman Forever (1995)  AND My Little Pony: The Movie  (2017) | Recommender: How do you feel about Japanese animation?  Specifically Miyazaki films?  Because I'm thinking My Neighbor Totoro | Recommender: I think it has a good message about family with a whimsical nature. | User: I dont think they have seen these | Recommender: Oh hey, about Totoro, there are actually two dubs for it, a Fox dub (done in the late 1980's) and a Disney dub (done in the mid-2000s).  Both are appropriate for children (but my preference is the Fox dub). | User: interesting | Recommender: You said they enjoyed Batman Forever (1995) , how do you feel about The Lego Batman Movie (2017) ? | User: I think my husband enjoyed that one more than they did lol | Recommender: No worries, lol.  :) | User: Thank you for all you help. HAve a great morning\nUser: hi | Recommender: Good morning. | Recommender: Is there a particular type of movie you are interested in? | User: I like Romance movies | Recommender: Are you a fan of Fifty Shades of Grey  (2015) ? | User: Absoutely, have seen them all so far | Recommender: I cannot wait for Fifty Shades Freed  (2018) . | User: Me to, its gonna be great. They really know what thier doing by having a Valentine release always | Recommender: If you would like to revisit classics, Tom Hanks and Meg Ryan are both amazing in You've Got Mail (1998) and Sleepless in Seattle (1993) . Both are very sweet romantic movies. | Recommender: Oh I definitely agree. Counting down to Valentine's Day :) | User: Yes they are, I have seen those as well. Love the classics | Recommender: A Walk to Remember (2002) and The Notebook (2013)  are really romantic Nicholas Sparks movies. | User: A walk to remember was so sad | Recommender: Yes it was but showed what true love is. | User: Definitely | Recommender: Hope my suggestions were helpful. Perhaps it is a day to revisit a classic romance? | User: Perhaps it is,  Have a great day\nRecommender: Good morning! | User: Morning! | Recommender: How are you today? | User: I'm swell. You? | Recommender: Shiny, thank you!  What can I help you find today? | User: Any good recommendations for drama movies?
