I am thinking | Recommender: I'm not thinking of any scifi that isn't superhero | User: My date suggested I Can Only Imagine (2018), and I don't want to see that. | User: Even a drama or love story would be good. | Recommender: Ah | User: I want to be armed with ideas because I Can Only Imagine (2018) is based on Christian music. | Recommender: Oh dear... lol | Recommender: How about an English romance/drama? | User: Sure, what is out? | Recommender: Finding Your Feet (2018) sounds like it might be interested | User: I will check it out. | Recommender: Roich, snobby woman forced to share living space with bohemian, poor sister, | User: Thanks for helping. | Recommender: Certainly not sci-fi! | Recommender: my pleasure | Recommender: Bye | User: Bye.\nRecommender: Hey there! | User: I want a movie that my girlfriends and I can go to this weekend. Something that is not a movie our boyfriends would take us to. | User: Some of us are getting a bit sick of action and superhero movies. | Recommender: I can understand that. What movies have you seen that you liked? | User: I saw Black Panther (2018)  and didn’t really like it, and nobody else who hasn’t seen it yet wants to see it. | User: We like Legally Blonde (2001) and the other ones in that series. | Recommender: What about Midnight Sun  (2018) it's a bit of a Romance. | Recommender: There is also Game Night (2018) which is supposed to be funny. | User: Is it set in Alaska? | User: Why is it midnight sun? | User: We did see Game Night (2018) and I did like it. | Recommender: It's about a girl that has a genetic condition which makes her unable to go outside into the sunlight. | User: Oh, that makes sense.  Did it get good reviews? | Recommender: And she falls in love with a guitarist and it runs from there.  It got a few good reviews.  I think it was mostly overlooked though thanks to all the Marvel and super hero movies popping out left and right. | User: I will check that out.  Thanks for the suggestions. | Recommender: Hope that helps! | User: Bye. | Recommender: Bye\nUser: Hi, I want to take the family to the movies this weekend.  They kids are in middle school. | User: They liked Coco  (2017), but it doesn’t have to be a cartoon. | Recommender: have you seen Jumanji  (2017) | User: I have read the book, but not seen the movie. Do you know the rating? | User: PG is probably the rating we are going for, but PG13 is probably too much. | Recommender: it is pg13 | User: Can you make an other suggestion? | User: I will check out Jumanji  (2017), but it might me too old for them. | User: They already said they don't want to see A Wrinkle in Time . | Recommender: what about Gnomeo & Juliet: Sherlock Gnomes (2018) | User: I think I saw one of those, is it the same characters as Gnomeo & Juliet (2011)? | User: They would like that, if I recall is has humor middle school boys would like. | Recommender: there is also I Can Only Imagine (2018) which is a family movie | User: I think I will take them to the gnomes.

I was hoping you could recommend a children's movie for me | Recommender: Is anyone there? | Recommender: Do they like superhero? | User: Something similar to The Incredibles (2004) | User: Or even Despicable Me (2010) | Recommender: Big Hero 6  (2014) | Recommender: I think that is a great movie that is similar to both the one you mentioned | User: They love super heros.  Big Hero 6  (2014) seems like a great idea! | Recommender: Wreck-It Ralph (2012) is more similar to Despicable Me (2010) | User: Great recommendation!  They also loved Bolt  (2008) and I loved that it had an animal super hero. | User: More great suggestions.  You sure know your animated movies!  My favorite of all time is The Lion King (1994) , but that's because it came out when I was young. | Recommender: If they like animal then Zootopia is a great choice | User: Thank you!  And thanks again for the great recommendations.  Have a great day. | Recommender: Thank you! you too.\nUser: Hi! | User: I am looking for some action movies | User: Something like Wonder Woman  (2017) would be great | Recommender: Hi | Recommender: One that comes to mind is Justice League  (2017).
