It has James Franco and Bryan Cranston | Recommender: Pretty funny came out a year or so ago | User: No, I haven't seen that one. I like both of those actors, so I'd probably like that | User: Any others that you'd recommend? | Recommender: Daddy's Home  (2015)  is one you'd probably like and the sequel comes out soon | User: Oh ok, I do remember seeing that trailer. Thanks I will try those two! | Recommender: Or claasic Adam Sandler movies like Happy Gilmore (1996) | User: Haha I do love that one | Recommender: And no problem.

She watches it at least once a year. | Recommender: Ok thank you for the advice! | User: You're welcome.  My kids really  like Star Wars.  What other type of movie do you think they might like? | Recommender: Maybe go with an 80's classic if they like the old Star wars movies.  Have they seen The Goonies (1985) | User: No actually- and they would like that one ! | Recommender: ok Great! | Recommender: my teenager likes scary movies that arent gory.  Any advice for that genre? | User: Hmm.  that is a tricky one.  I don't really know:( | User: But maybe she would like a thriller like The Silence of the Lambs  (1991) | Recommender: I will try that. Thanks | User: OK:)  I think we are good here? | Recommender: yeah.  I think we are done with the task.  Thanks\nUser: Can you recommend a super hero movie for me? | Recommender: howdy, yes i think i can.
