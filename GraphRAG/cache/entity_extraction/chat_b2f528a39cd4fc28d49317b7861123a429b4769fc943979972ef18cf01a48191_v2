Bye | Recommender: Yeah Ive heard of it too but haven't seen it yet | Recommender: You're welcome. Take care.\nUser: HI!  Any recommendations for good comedies?  Not the &quot;it's so funny it's stupid&quot; kind. | Recommender: Sure! I know quite a few. Have you seen Why Him%3F (2016) | User: I have not even heard of that movie.  I'll have to look it up. | User: I want to see the latest Pitch Perfect 3 (2017) movie but haven't had a chance to yet. | Recommender: Okay, so you like musical related comedies? | User: I guess.  I don't know if I've thought of that one as a musical.  I did just see The Greatest Showman (2017) which is a musical but not a comedy.  It was great. | Recommender: I agree. I would also contest that Oz the Great and Powerful (2013) was a good one too, somewhat similar | User: I have not seen that one either.  I did like the The Wizard of Oz  (1939) when I was little. | Recommender: This one is completely different and gives a new take on things. Very interesting. | User: Ok I'll have to check it out! | Recommender: Are there any other genres that you particularly care for? | User: I like adventure and romantic comedies too! | User: And Action | Recommender: Same here! I would probably recommend The Big Sick (2017). Its comedy and romance and a bit of drama. | User: I haven't seen or heard of that one either.  I'll have to rent it and check it out! | User: Thanks for all your suggestions | Recommender: No problem! I'm glad to help.\nRecommender: Hi there! What kind of movies are you interested in? | User: HI!  Any recommendations for good action movies? | Recommender: Have you seen John Wick (2014)? | User: I have not seen that !  I'll have to look it up! | Recommender: There is also a sequel that just released last year. I would also suggest that. John Wick: Chapter 2 (2017) | User: I've never even heard of it and there's a sequel.  I'm going to have to watch both | Recommender: I don't know how old you are, or if you would create any nostalgia for you, but the Power Rangers  (2017) movie is actually really good! | User: I have not seen that one either.  I think Wonder Woman  (2017) was one of the last I've seen that was more an action movie. | User: It was good! | Recommender: Okay, that is a great one! So you are a superhero fan? Have you seen the Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2 (2017) movie yet? | User: I'm not a huge superhero fan but I like some of them!  Guardians of the Galaxy  (2014) was good! | Recommender: I completely agree. How do you feel about Thor: Ragnarok (2017)? | User: I have not seen that one but wouldn't mind seeing it!  I'll have to rent it | User: Thank you for all your suggestions! | Recommender: No problem! Its been a pleasure.\nRecommender: Hello what type of movies are you looking for? | User: Hello! I'd like some recommendations for a horror movie. | User: Ones that I've liked recently are like Get Out (2017) or Don't Breathe (2016) | Recommender: well a really good one that I saw the other day was Jigsaw (2017) | Recommender: yeah those were both good movies | User: I stayed away from Jigsaw (2017) since I didn't like the last few Saw movies. Do you have any other recommendations? | Recommender: I sure do have you seen It  (2017) yet? | User: I did! I really liked It  (2017) . I thought the effects were cool and the kids were good actors. | User: Do you have a ghost or haunted house movie to recommend? I like those. | Recommender: another really good one that I saw recently was Jeepers Creepers 3 (2017) it really explains alot | Recommender: Yes Annabelle 2 (2017) was a great one well it was more haunted doll but still | User: I'll check those two out! | User: Thank you! | Recommender: you are welcome have a great day bye | User: Bye\nUser: Hello. | Recommender: HI! What kind of movies do you like? | User: I really like horror movies, with paranormal themes. | Recommender: Did you see The Sixth Sense (1999) ?  I know it's an older one but good. | User: Oh yeah! That was a really good one. The ending was a major twist. | Recommender: So do you like stuff like The Exorcist III (1990) ?  I'm not a horror fan at all but seems most people like that one. | User: I didn't see that one. I wasn't really big on the Exorcist movies for some reason. | Recommender: I think the last horror movie I saw was The Ring  (2002).  I didn't like it but I've heard people that like horror did. |\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}], "parameters": {"model": "gpt-3.5-turbo", "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "temperature": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0}}}
