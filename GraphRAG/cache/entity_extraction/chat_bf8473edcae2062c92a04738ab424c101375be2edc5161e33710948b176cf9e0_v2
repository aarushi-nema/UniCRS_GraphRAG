Thanks\nUser: Hi! | Recommender: Hey! What's one of your favorite movies? | User: I'm looking for movies similar to The Nutty Professor (1963) | Recommender: Oh that is such a good one! | Recommender: Have you seen Tommy Boy (1995) ? | User: Nope, I haven't seen that. | Recommender: it's one of my favorites. Chris Farley and David Spade. VERY FUNNY | User: Love both of them! | User: Looking for any comedy really. | Recommender: They also did another movie together called Black Sheep  (1996) | User: Great! Haven't seen that one. | Recommender: The Waterboy (1998) is also very funny! It has Adam Sandler in it! I love all those actors. | User: I used to love David Spade on Just Shoot Me. | User: I love The Waterboy (1998) too | Recommender: I should watch that lol. I havn't seen that show yet. | User: Haven't seen The Waterboy (1998) in a long time.

Have you ever seen Meet the Fockers (2004) ? It's not explicitly about a wedding but I believe it leads into it. | User: Oh my goodness!  That movie is absolutely hilarious!  Did you see the prequel, Meet the Parents (2000) ? | User: I love comedies! | User: Did you ever see Father of the Bride  (1991) ? | Recommender: Me too! I'm not sure, I may have. What happens in it? It sounds really familiar. | Recommender: That one I have not seen! | User: In Meet the Parents (2000), Gaylord has to meet his girlfriend's parents.  The Dad really gives him the runaround. | Recommender: Ahhh yes! That's the one. I really wanted to smack Gaylord in that one. He could have avoided a lot of problems if he just stopped lying! | User: One of my favorite parts was when he said that he milked a cat. | Recommender: How about The Wedding Planner (2001) ? I don't think this one is as funny but it's kind of like a fairytale if you're into romance. | Recommender: That was truly horrifying, haha! | User: I agree.  The Wedding Planner (2001) isn't quite as comical.  It's more of a chick flick, I guess.  I liked it, though. | User: Thanks for all of the suggestions!  I am excited to get out the tissues! (from laughing or crying!) | Recommender: No problem! Don't forget the pint of ice cream to either laugh and eat or cry into! | User: Ha ha!
