Confidential  (1997) | User: I have never seen that movie but it looks really good! The second movie you mentioned I never heard of, what is that one about? | Recommender: Okay you might like Forrest Gump (1994) | Recommender: The second movie has Russell Crow. Its great. | Recommender: Or Good Will Hunting (1997) | User: I love that movie. Tom Hanks is one of my favorite actors, I think he did amazing in that one.

Nice chat and happy holidays. | User: Happy holidays, have a great night. Thank you again!\nRecommender: Hellow | Recommender: Hello | User: Hi, I am looking for some good holiday movies to watch with the family | Recommender: I want to recommend The Sixth Sense (1999) . It was a movie that came out in the 90s and it features Bruce Willis | Recommender: What are some of the movies that you like? | User: Bruce Willis is an action star. Is this an action movie? | Recommender: It is not an action movie. It is a movie about a boy seeing people who have died and he is having problems dealing with his gift | User: Oh, that is not the type of movie I'm looking for. I want a feel-good movie like Miracle on 34th Street (1947) | Recommender: Ok. Some feel good movies I can recommend are Elf  (2003) , The Polar Express  (2004) , Santa Baby  , and The Santa Clause (1994) . These are all lovely movies | User: I have heard of @Elf, The Polar Express  (2004) , and The Santa Clause (1994) . Can you tell me a little about @Santa  Baby? | Recommender: Santa Claus' health takes a turn for the worse in Santa Baby  and his daughter is left having to run Christmas while he is not able to | User: Santa Baby  | User: Oh. That sounds like it might be interesting. I will check it out. Thanks a lot | Recommender: Your welcome. Any other movie questions? | User: I think you have given me several good suggestions. That's enough for now. | Recommender: Ok then, goodbye\nRecommender: Morning! | User: Good morning | Recommender: What sorts of films are you interested in this morning? | User: I'm looking for some light-hearted comedies. Nothing too cheesy or romantic | Recommender: Hmm.. Okay, what about something like Mrs. Doubtfire (1993) ? Something along those lines? | User: Yes. I've seen that already, but that's the type of movie I am looking for. | Recommender: Or perhaps Shaun of the Dead (2004) ? Or is that too silly for your tastes? | Recommender: Also Office Space (1999) is a good one. It's old, but an enjoyable film to watch | User: I don't think I've seen that, but I don't remember it being a light- hearted comedy. Maybe a family movie like Are We There Yet%3F  (2005) | User: Office Space (1999) is a good movie. One of my favorites, but I've seen it so many times | Recommender: Then have you seen Wild Hogs (2007) with Travolta, Tim Allen and Martin Lawrence? | Recommender: It reminds me of Are We There Yet%3F  (2005) but with grown men on motorcycles, lol | User: I have seen that too. You're right, it is kind of similar. I do like road trip movies. Anything more recent? | Recommender: Recent? How about Masterminds  (2016) or The Boss  (2016) with Melissa Mcarthy? | User: Yeah. I did want to see. The Boss  (2016) | User: Thanks. That's a good choice. | User: I'll look it up.
