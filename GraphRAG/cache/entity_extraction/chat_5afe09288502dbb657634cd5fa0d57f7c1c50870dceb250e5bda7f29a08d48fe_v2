I'd like to help you find a movie if that's okay | User: I am having a good evening, thanks. I hope you are as well. I'm trying to find some new movies to watch in either horror or drama. | Recommender: Horror is always fun.  I know a lot of people say no way but I love a good horror. | Recommender: Would you be able to share with me one or two movies you have seen to make it easier for me to pinpoint a movie for you? | User: Sure. I recently watched The Conjuring 2 (2016)  and it was great. I loved The Cabin in the Woods  but I realize I'm not going to find anything like it. That movie was a class of its own. | Recommender: Oh wasn't it?!  A movie that I also consider definitely in a class of it's own is The Shining  (1980).  It was soooo good. | User: I watched it years ago. I would definitely enjoy refreshing my memory though. Stephen King movies are normally very good. I know its more of a cult classic than mainstream but I could watch Maximum Overdrive (1986)  over and over again. | Recommender: Oh yes, really great movies.  Have you seen Cujo  (1983) yet.  More scary then chilling but still good. | User: I never watched that one but I read the book. I will check it out. Thank you. | Recommender: That is awesome.  I am so pleased I could help you.
