I am so glad I could help and you have a splendid day!\nUser: Hey there | Recommender: Hey know any good dramas? | Recommender: I mean do you like dramas | User: Sure, got any requests? | Recommender: Well I watched The Shawshank Redemption (1994) for the first time the other day and loved it | User: *suggestions lol | Recommender: We're both having a day huh? I also enjoyed Blade Runner 2049 (2017), though that's more of a scifi drama | Recommender: My husband rented us Dunkirk  (2017) the other day, not too much talking but loads of great scenes | User: I really liked Good Will Hunting (1997) | User: I like when Robin Williams played serious roles | Recommender: Good one, I liked Matt Damon in The Martian  (2015), and One Hour Photo (2002) with Robin Williams was very serious if you haven't seen it | User: Okay I'll look in to both of those | User: Thank you! | Recommender: Bye\nRecommender: Hey | User: Hello! | Recommender: What was the last movie you saw in the theater? | User: The latest Insidious by Blum House Productions. Was a real disappointment. | User: Since nearly all their horror movies are good, most of the Insidious ones anyway. | Recommender: So you like horror flicks? | User: That's one of the genres I like, yes. | User: Insidious: The Last Key (2018) was kind of boring and fast paced I feel like. Not much happened in the movie. I had expected more. | Recommender: Have you seen Jigsaw (2017)  ? | User: I have no seen the newest Jigsaw, actually. Been meaning to. | User: I am kind of waiting for my husband to come home for transit leave so we can watch it together. But then we might not have time since we're moving to Hawaii soon after he comes back home. | User: We only have about a week to get ready. | User: Have you seen Kingsman: The Secret Service (2014) | Recommender: Probably out on video now...isn't it a continuation of the Saw  (2004) | Recommender: I have seen it.  Better than Kingsman: The Golden Circle for sure. | User: Yeah, still would like to wait to watch it with my husband. We usually stream it anyways. I believe it is. | User: Kingsman: The Golden Circle in my opinion was good, but certainly not better than the previous. | Recommender: Anything besides horror flicks? | User: I do like action, fantasy, mystery, comedy as well. | User: Oh, right! I have yet to see the new The Maze Runner  (2014) .. | User: I forgot what it was called. | User: Maze Runner: The Death Cure (2018) ! | Recommender: If you like spy movies Spectre  (2015) would be a good choice. | User: I love Dylan O Brien, honestly. | User: Oh, so James Bond eh? | User: I would be interested in seeing that. I just may watch it tonight. | Recommender: I don't like the Maze Runner: The Death Cure (2018) series because I think they advertise towards kids.  Yes, James Bond. | User: I don't think it's towards kids, per say. Perhaps younger audience, sure. | User: I'm 22, young adult so it's perfect. | Recommender: Justice League  (2017) is the movie of the year for me. | Recommender: If you like action, it is worth seeing twice. | Recommender: Have a good night. | Recommender: Goodbye\nRecommender: Hi there! | Recommender: What kind of movies do you like? | User: Hi! I'm looking for a movie suggestion. | Recommender: I recently saw The Big Sick (2017) and really liked it. | User: I like romantic comedies, and I also like movies that make me think or that make me question things. | User: I haven't seen that movie yet. | Recommender: Have you seen How to Lose a Guy in 10 Days (2003) ? I liked that one. | Recommender: I would say The Big Sick (2017) is a romantic comedy. It is also based off of a true story. | User: As far as movies that make me question things, I like movies like The Matrix (1999), The Truman Show (1998) , etc. | Recommender: I haven't seen either of those. | User: Yes, I did see How to Lose a Guy in 10 Days (2003) , and I liked it. | Recommender: What about Me Before You  ? Not a comedy, but so good! | Recommender: Or Wedding Crashers (2005) ? | User: I have heard of Me Before You  , but I don't know much about it.  I'll try to look for that one, as well as The Big Sick (2017) . | Recommender: I think you would like them both. | User: I have seen Wedding Crashers (2005) and liked it. | Recommender: Hope
