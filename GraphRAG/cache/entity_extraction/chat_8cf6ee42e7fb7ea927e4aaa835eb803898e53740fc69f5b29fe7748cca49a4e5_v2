I'll have to check that out. | User: Me either. | Recommender: What about 10 Cloverfield Lane (2016) | User: It reminds of Final Destination 5 (2011) . It's always questionable when they will actually be at the 'final.' | Recommender: lol | User: I have seen that. It was very good. | Recommender: well the first Scary Movie (2000) had to be at least decent, for a parody.  otherwise why make 4 mre? | User: Yes. I liked it.
