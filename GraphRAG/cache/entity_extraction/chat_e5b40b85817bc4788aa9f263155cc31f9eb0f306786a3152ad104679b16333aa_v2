Have a great day and enjoy the movie :) | User: Thanks!\nRecommender: Hi, how are you? | User: Hi. Snowed in actually so looking for a movie to pass the time. | User: Do you know any good romantic comedies that you would recommend? | Recommender: 27 Dresses (2008) is a great one | User: Oh I watched that one. Not a huge fan of Katherine Heigel though. | User: I really enjoy Sandra Bullock movies. | Recommender: The Proposal  (2009) is another good one with Sandra Bullock! | User: Oh I loved that one. Plus Ryan Reynolds looked amazing in that movie. | Recommender: Right? Forces of Nature (1999) is decent, but it's a little bit older. | User: Oh I forgot all about that movie. I thought it was okay but not a top pick. | Recommender: Have you seen While You Were Sleeping  (1995)? | User: No I don't think I have. Would you recommend it? | Recommender: I'd give it a solid 7/10. | User: I will check it out today. Thank you for the suggestion. | Recommender: No problem!\nRecommender: Hey ... How are you | Recommender: What movie are you in the mood tonight? | User: Great thanks. | Recommender: to watch | User: Would love a recent action movie to check out. Any good recommends? | Recommender: I just finished watching Kingsman: The Golden Circle  ... did you see it? | User: No I haven't. What is it about? | Recommender: it is about a british secrent agency | User: Oh sounds interesting! | Recommender: it pays homage to bond but in a really fun way | Recommender: if you want something more superhero action .. then I suggest ... Thor: Ragnarok (2017) | User: Is it family friendly? | User: My kids like superheroes. | Recommender: I would not say it is family friendly | Recommender: have you seen Thor yet? | User: No I haven't. | Recommender: ok .. if it is for kids .. and super heroes .. then Spider-Man: Homecoming (2017)  .. they will love it | Recommender: have you seen it sir? | User: Yes. We enjoyed Spider-Man: Homecoming (2017) a great deal | Recommender: how about Wonder Woman  (2017) | Recommender: it is a really good movie | User: I have not watched Wonder Woman  (2017) .

I assume you have watched the &quot;classics&quot; like The Texas Chain Saw Massacre (1974)  and Halloween  (1978) ? | User: i love both of those movies! They're classics! | Recommender: Yes they definitely are! If you want something more recent, a new you could check out the It  (2017) remake or even the Poltergeist  (2015)  remake. Both are pretty good. | Recommender: I do admit the original Poltergeist  (1982) is much better than the remake. | User: I happen to agree with you on that. I haven't seen the remake of It  (2017) though yet | Recommender: The new It  (2017) is much better than the original. I recommend it! | Recommender: Would you like more suggestions? | User: Actually, I think I'm going to watch It  (2017) tonight! | Recommender: Great. I hope you enjoy it.

I'm looking for a kid friendly movie today. | User: We like animated films like Zootopia | Recommender: Have you seen Despicable Me 2 (2013) ? | User: Yes, we are in the minority of people that don't care for the minions franchise. | Recommender: Don't worry, I don't like it either. Bambi  (2013) is a classic! | User: Yes I like that one too. | User: It's always so teary when Bambi's mother dies. | Recommender: I know, right? The Secret Life of Pets (2016) is a more upbeat one! | User: That sounds great! | User: I even think it is available on Netflix. | Recommender: I think it is too! | User: Great.  We will watch that. | User: Thanks for all your help.  Have a nice weekend. | Recommender: Alright!
