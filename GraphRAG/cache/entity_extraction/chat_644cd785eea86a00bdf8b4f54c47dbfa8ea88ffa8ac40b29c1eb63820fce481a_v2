I watched Hidden Figures (2016) recently. It was more uplifting, if not as realistic. | Recommender: I think you might like it. | User: Yes I think I will. I'll check that one out. Brad Pitt stars right? | Recommender: Yeah, couldn't get into Hidden Figures (2016) myself. | Recommender: That's the one | User: It was good but I doubt that is really how the story went. I've heard good things about Inglourious Basterds (2009) . It reminds me a bit of Legends of the Fall (1994) | Recommender: Oh yeah...forgot what that movie was about though. | Recommender: I get that one and Braveheart (1995) confused for some reason | User: They were both inspirational movies where the hero didn't really get the glory. I think that is why they just don't seem right. The good guys don't win. | User: Thank you for your suggestions and the great conversation. | Recommender: You're welcome! Have a good night.\nRecommender: Hey there! | Recommender: What kind of movies are you looking for today? | User: Hi!  I'm looking for a movie that's set in a non-US location.

It's a cute movie set in Ireland! | User: I have seen it and liked it, but it was quite a while ago!  Good suggestion, I may pick it up to watch again. | Recommender: Absolutely! One that's a little more of a drama is Seven Years in Tibet  (1997) ! It's such a great movie though. | Recommender: It's set in Tibet and China! | User: Oh, that sounds great!  I haven't seen that one. | Recommender: It's fantastic! The last one is actually a French movie, but it is set in France! Have you seen Amélie (2001) ? | User: No, I haven't seen that one yet!  I have been meaning to, so maybe I'll look for that! | User: Thanks for the great suggestions! | Recommender: You should check it out! Of course! | Recommender: Have a great day!\nRecommender: Hello, what kinds of movies do you like? | User: I like marvel movies. | User: What kind of movies do  you enjoy? | User: I am looking forward to the new Black Panther (2018) | Recommender: I liked Logan  (2017) and I would recommend it! | Recommender: I want to see that! | User: Justice League  (2017)  was a good one and I recommend it | User: Logan  (2017)  was good | User: Did you see Suicide Squad  (2016) ? | Recommender: Have you seen Wonder Woman  (2017)? | User: Yes that was  a good movie too.  I don't miss many marvel movies lol. | User: Have you seend Jumanji  (2017) at the movies yet.  We enjoyed that too. | Recommender: Have you seen Ghost Rider  (1982) ?

How about classic movies. | User: The year doesn't matter. | Recommender: Do you mean John Wayne movies or movies like It's a Wonderful Life (1946) ? | User: Why, yes that works. | Recommender: Gone with the Wind  (1939)  was a good classic movie. | User: I do like John Wayne.. A Fistful of Dollars (1964) | Recommender: I really liked the original Citizen Kane (1941)  too. | User: I know that was Clint Eastwood, but in the same vein | Recommender: I haven't seen that one. I'll have to check it out. | User: There was a remake, yes? | Recommender: Yes. They made a new one a few years ago. | User: I thought so. Do you know of any other westerns? Something like Tombstone  (1993) ? | Recommender: Stagecoach  (1939) ch  that was a good movie. | User: That sounds great. Well, looks like I'll have a busy night.
