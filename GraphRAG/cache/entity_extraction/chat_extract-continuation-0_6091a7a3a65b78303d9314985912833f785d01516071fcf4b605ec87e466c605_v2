Good to hear your thoughts on comedies. | User: Bye now. | Recommender: have a good one\nRecommender: Hello | User: Hi, what kind of comedies could you recommend? Family type stuff. | Recommender: Have you seen Zootopia yet? | User: Haven't seen that one, but have heard good things.

I also liked Pretty in Pink (1986) | Recommender: How about Mary Poppins  (1964) - can't get much more classic than that.  Or Mrs. Doubtfire (1993)? | User: And liked Sixteen Candles (1984) | User: I think I've seen them all! | Recommender: Well if you've seen all the classics already, why don't you try some of the newer movies? | User: Never did see Mary Poppins  (1964) though | Recommender: There's a lot of new movies out, like The Boss Baby (2017) | User: Yeah, I definitely would see newer ones, too.

It doesn't have much gore. | Recommender: How about A Nightmare on Elm Street  (2010) ? | User: No.  What is 1922  about? | Recommender: It's about a farmer who kills his wife, and gets his son to help. | User: Oh wow!!
