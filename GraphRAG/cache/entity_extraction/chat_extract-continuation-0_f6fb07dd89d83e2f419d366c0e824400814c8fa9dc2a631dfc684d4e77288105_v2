I haven't seen Dr. Dolittle  (1998) since I was a young child! | Recommender: Or why don't you try Click  (2006) or maybe The Love Bug (1968). | Recommender: A classic! | User: Oh man, you're right on track! I haven't seen Click  (2006) since it was in theaters, or The Love Bug (1968) since I was a little kid! | Recommender: Freaky Friday  (1976) or Freaky Friday  (2003) were good identity switch comedies. | User: These are all great suggestions! :) | User: I have seen the newer one, but would love to check out the original Freaky Friday  (1976)   Makes me think of how they re-made Cheaper by the Dozen  (1950) with Cheaper by the Dozen  (2003) | User: But anyhow, I thank you once again kindly for the thoughtful movie suggestions!

I loved it, but he wasn't as in love as he said it doesn't compare to the books well enough. | User: Hollywood Shuffle (1987) is one I've been told to watch, and haven't yet...I'll definitely put that on the list! | User: Thank you for all of the wonderful suggestions! :\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>BLACK PANTHER (2018)<|>MOVIE<|>A 2018 superhero movie that has gained immense popularity)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>A WRINKLE IN TIME<|>MOVIE<|>A movie that was planned to be watched over the weekend)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>DR.
