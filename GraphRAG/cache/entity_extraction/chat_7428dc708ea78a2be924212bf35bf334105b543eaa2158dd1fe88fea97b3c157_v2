Thank you. Hope you have a good night, too. | Recommender: thank you1\nUser: Hi! Can you recommend a good movie for the weekend? | Recommender: Hmm... something old or newly released? | User: New. We're going to the theater | Recommender: Then I'd recommend Murder on the Orient Express (2017) | User: How was it? I heard it was good. | Recommender: It is. It's a really good film. Has a ton of big name actors in it. | Recommender: I'd also recommend It  (2017) . It's a remake but one of the best remakes I've seen | User: Okay, wonderful. I think she might like those. What about Jigsaw (2017) ? My gf says she wants to see it. | Recommender: Umm...if she's a fan of the previous Saw  (2004) and other films, then don't see this one. It doesn't compare. | User: Okay. Thanks man, I appreciate it. | Recommender: welcome. have a good weekend.\nUser: Hey | User: how you doing tonight? | Recommender: Hello, good, thank you. What kind of movies do you like? | User: I am looking for a good movie with music in it. Something like Garden State  (2004) or even a musical like West Side Story  (1961) | User: But I didn't like La La Land  (2016) | Recommender: Ok, have you seen The Sound of Music  (1965)? | User: I have and it is one of my favorites! Anything like that would be great | Recommender: I like it, too. Ok, how about The Music Man  (1962)? | User: I have that movie and have never seen it!! Haha | User: My mother loves it | User: Is the music good? | Recommender: My mom loves it, too. Yeah it's a lot of marching band music. | User: I think I would probably like that. I have had the dvd for years. | User: still in the package | Recommender: Oh wow, yeah I would definitely suggest watching it. | User: I definitely will. Thank you for reminding me of it | User: Have a good one. | Recommender: You're welcome. You too. | User: Thank you\nUser: Hello. Can you recommend a good action flick this evening? | Recommender: Sure! Might I suggest Justice League  (2017) | Recommender: It's a great movie. A Bit long, but still good | User: I want to see that but the gf doesn't, lol | Recommender: so I guess Thor: Ragnarok (2017) is out of the question too then? | User: Pretty much. | Recommender: Well.......How about Dunkirk  (2017) ? It's not in theaters, it's on DVD but it's still a great movie. It's a war drama | User: lol, no go either | Recommender: ?? Well what kind of action movies does she like? | User: She liked Transformers: Dark of the Moon (2011) okay | Recommender: Okay so maybe she'll like Transformers: The Last Knight (2017) then | User: I hope. She's picky. I can't stand it. | User: she's always nagging me about something | Recommender: Oh okay. Well I hope she likes the movie. Glad I could help | Recommender: night!\nUser: Hello! | Recommender: Hello, how are you? | User: I'm good, thank you | User: Would you mind helping me find a feel good movie tonight? | Recommender: What kind of movies do you like? | User: I like stuff like How to Lose a Guy in 10 Days (2003) or New Year's Eve  (2002) | Recommender: Ok, have you seen 27 Dresses (2008)? | User: I did! I actually like that. I am not a huge Kathryn Heigl fan, but shes a good actress | User: Did you ever see her in My Father the Hero  (1994) when she was a teen? | Recommender: No, I didn't see that one but I liked her in Wish Upon a Star. | User: I havent seen that one. Was it when she was younger? | User: Like a made for tv movie? | Recommender: Yeah, it came out in the mid-90s. It was a Disney movie.\nUser: Hello. Can you recommend a good anime for me? | Recommender: Anime or animated movies? Kind of a difference there. | User: Anime. No Cars 3  (2017) or pixar movies or nothing like that | Recommender: You want a single film or multiple? If the latter I would suggest Ghost in the Shell  (1995) and it's subsequent titles | User: Is that like Akira  (1988) ? | Recommender: No, but it does discuss politics and societal norms like it. It's more of a philosophical/political drama | Recommender: still really good. And the subsequent films Ghost in the Shell: Stand Alone Complex - Solid State Society (2006) and Ghost in the Shell 2: Innocence dive even deeper into those themes | User: Okay. Sounds like a plan.
