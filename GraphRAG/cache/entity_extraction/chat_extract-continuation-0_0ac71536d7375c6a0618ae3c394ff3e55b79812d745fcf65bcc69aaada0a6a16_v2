That's my personal favorite | User: No, I haven't seen it. I'll check it out. | User: I am looking for movies like Snowpiercer (2013) too | Recommender: I personally really liked Interstellar  (2014) | Recommender: However, you need to really pay attention to it. The first time I watched it, I wasn't giving it my full attention and I had no clue what was going on | User: I haven't seen that one. Sounds good. | Recommender: You should check it out! I highly recommend it | User: Thanks for the tip! | Recommender: If you're looking for another film, The Martian  (2015) is really good | Recommender: Matt Damon plays quite a believable character | User: I enjoyed The Martian  (2015) too. | User: Thanks for all the suggestions. | Recommender: It's a great film! | Recommender: You're welcome | Recommender: have a good night | User: Have a good night.

I'm in the mood for a good comedy. | Recommender: Have you seen Anchorman  ? I found that one hilarioius | User: Yes. I thought that was very funny! | Recommender: Have you seen Mrs. Doubtfire (1993) ? | Recommender: I was laughing so hard when I saw that one the first time | User: Robin Williams, yes. He is really good. I was so sad when he passed away. | User: I like his movies so much! | Recommender: Yes! if you like robin williams, I'm sure you'd like Dead Poets Society (1989) | Recommender: That movie was so inspiring. | User: Is it slapstick funny, like ¡Three Amigos! (1986) or deeper? | Recommender: It's not really a comedy, it just has robin williams in it | Recommender: It's actually kind of sad as one of the main characters commits suicide | User: Oh, I really would like a comedy. | User: Something cheerful. | Recommender: Ooops. sorry about that! | Recommender: It's a bit crude, but have you seen Due Date ?

What kind of movies do you enjoy watching? | User: I like dramas and comedies. | User: I like Lost in Translation  (2003) . | Recommender: Have you ever seen Million Dollar Baby (2004) ? It's a very good drama. | User: No, I haven't seen it. It sounds like a good movie. | User: I also like some action. I like the movie Crank  (2006) . | Recommender: It's very good, but a bit intense. | User: Sounds good to me. | Recommender: Do you like historical dramas with action? The Beast  (1996) helps explain how the war in Afghanistan drained so much from our country and people, and helped lead the the crash of the economy in 1991, and our collapse. It's western made but well done. | Recommender: You might find it both exciting and educational. | User: I haven't heard of that one before. Thanks for the suggestion. | Recommender: You are welcome! Of course! | User: I like The Fog (1980) . Is it similar? | Recommender: I've never seen The Fog (1980). | Recommender: But if it's a historically accurate war film, yes! | Recommender: I know Saving Private Ryan (1998) is a very action filled American war film, told from an American perspective. I was fascinated! | Recommender: Have you ever seen that? | User: Yes, I am looking for a more atmospheric drama. Not in the mood for war movies. | Recommender: Oh, okay. Let my think...hmmm.. | Recommender: How about Thelma & Louise (1991) ? It's a very intense drama. | Recommender: Or would you like something newer? | User: Yeah, I agree. I was on the edge of my seat for that one. | Recommender: How about Phantom Thread (2017) ? | Recommender: It's set in London. | User: No, haven't heard of it. I'll look it up. | User: Thanks for the suggestions. Have a good night! | Recommender: You're very welcome. I hope I've been helpful!\nUser: Hello.  How are you? | Recommender: Hi.
