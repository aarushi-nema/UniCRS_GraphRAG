Kid movies are my specialty lol Have you seen the new Coco  (2017) | User: WE have seen that it was really good | Recommender: Awesome! I also loved Moana  (2016) it is great. Umm do you have girls? I loved the Barbie of Swan Lake as a little girl | User: I have 4 girls actually. We just rewatched Moana  (2016)  last night | User: I cant believe its been 2 years since it came out tho | User: They like barbies but nit sure they would sit through a movie.  I really think we should watch the The Swan Princess (1994) | Recommender: I loved that one. I love old time movies too Cinderella  (1947) was great to me! | User: An oldie but a goodie | Recommender: Definitely, well I hope these work for you and maybe give the barbies a shot one day haha | User: Thank you for all the suggestions. | Recommender: Have a great day!\nUser: Good morning! | Recommender: Good morning! What kind of movie would you like to watch | User: I'm looking for a musical.  I do theater and I need to brush up on my repertoire. | User: I saw Fiddler on the Roof  (1971) recently and I really enjoyed it. | Recommender: Have you seen Chicago  (2002) that was pretty good | User: I can't say I have, but I've heard a few of the songs in auditions.  I'll look into it. | Recommender: I have heard Into the Woods  (2014) was good it is a musical but has magic in it as well | Recommender: that is a disney movie | User: I haven't seen that one either, but I've heard good things.  The only complaint I heard was Johnny Depp tapped a little too much into Sweeney Todd: The Demon Barber of Fleet Street  (2007) (which was one I enjoyed) for his Big Bad Wolf. | Recommender: I enjoyed Sweeney Todd too have seen it many times. Another good one was Hairspray  (2007) | User: I bought that one for my girlfriend.  We both enjoy it.  :) | User: I think I've got a couple of good ones to look into.  Thank you for the suggestions and have a great day! | Recommender: Glad I could help. Have a good day.\nUser: Hello how are you? | Recommender: Hey im doing pretty good today | Recommender: What films are you into? | User: Its prety chilly today and my kids cant go outside so I  need some good kid films | Recommender: Hmmm have you heard of Moana  (2016) | Recommender: I also really enjoyed The Boss Baby (2017) | User: I have, we just watched it last night again. Michigan weathers been crazy | Recommender: Its super cold here as well were in Buffalo | User: We havent watched The Boss Baby (2017)  in a min, so thats a contender | Recommender: My little one loves that film. One other option could be Coco  (2017) if you know where to find the film haha | User: I may or may not have seen it several times. | User: Such a cute movie that was sad twist but good ending | Recommender: I don't know how disney does it but they make amazing films | Recommender: So you would like to watch The Boss Baby (2017) ? | User: Heck I didnt know until yesterday that Captain America: The First Avenger  was a disney movie. | User: Yes we will prob watch that today. Thank you | User: Thank you for your suggestions. Have a great morning. | Recommender: Disney just purchased 20th Century Fox | Recommender: You as well. Goodbye and stay warm\nUser: Hi | Recommender: Good morning!  How are you? | User: I am doing pretty good. Can you suggest some good action movies | Recommender: How do you feel about comic book movies? | User: I love comic book movies one of my favorites is Wonder Woman  (2017) and Green Lantern  (2011) | Recommender: I loved Wonder Woman  (2017) but I haven't seen Green Lantern  (2011). | Recommender: Have you seen the new Justice League  (2017)? | User: No I haven't seen that one yet. was it good | Recommender: I enjoyed it.  I loved Wonder Woman in it, but I was also surprised at how well they did Cyborg (who is usually left out of Justice League stories half the time). | User: Yeah they do leave him out a lot. The Avengers  (2012) was good | Recommender: Have you seen Thor: Ragnarok (2017)?  I didn't expect to like it as much as I did, but it's soundtrack is reminiscent of 1980s film and the humor keeps a light-hearted approach to an otherwise dark film. | Recommender: Plus, Jeff Goldblum doing what Jeff Goldblum does best.  :) | User: I haven't seen that one either. I will have to watch those | User: thanks for the help. Have a good day. | Recommender: No problem.  Have a great day!\nUser: Hello | User: How are you today? | Recommender: Im doing really well | User: I am looking for newer kids movies like Coco  (\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}], "parameters": {"model": "gpt-3.5-turbo", "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "temperature": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0}}}
