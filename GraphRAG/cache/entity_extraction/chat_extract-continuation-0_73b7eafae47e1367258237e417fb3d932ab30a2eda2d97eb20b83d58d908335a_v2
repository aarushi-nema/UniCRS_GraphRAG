We haven't seen it but are willing to watch anything safe. | Recommender: Yes! Give it a shot | User: We can do that. | Recommender: Although the newest Jumanji  (2017) is my favorite newer-ish kid-friendly movie | User: I haven't seen the new one. I loved the older one. | Recommender: It really is good haha | Recommender: Hope you enjoy! | User: Isn't the new one the one with Dwayne Johnson and Karen Gilan? | Recommender: Yes. Instead of a board game, it's a video game this time | Recommender: It's funny, action-packed | Recommender: Very good | User: Sounds just as interesting as the original! | Recommender: Hope you have a good day! | User: Thanks for the recommendations! Have a great day! :) | Recommender: Goodbye! | User: Goodbye\nUser: Hello! | Recommender: Hi. What are you here for? | User: I'm looking for a good movie. Any genre except for horror. | User: Any suggestions from something you really like? | Recommender: The last very good movie I saw was Love, Simon (2018). It was very heartfelt and funny.  I also saw The Black Panther  (1977), which was action packed, and Tomb Raider (2018). | Recommender: I also rewatched The Princess Bride  (1987) and it was just as funny as I remembered. | User: Wow. I haven't seen any of those newer ones. Why did you like Love, Simon (2018)? I know the critics gave it pretty good reviews, but some people I know thought it was just okay. | User: Ha, that last one is a classic. I used to watch it when I was little! | Recommender: I think  Love, Simon (2018) felt more like a classic coming of age movie. There weren't any fancy effects, and it was simple, but that's why I liked it. It really stood out among the current movies that all have CGI or overdone plots. | User: That's true. I'll have to see it. | Recommender: It went back to basics, which was really refreshing. | Recommender: I hope I suggested some things you can watch. | User: I recently watched Larry Crowne (2011) which is kind of like that. Just simple but a good story. | User: Yes. Thank you! I'll have to watch those. | Recommender: I haven't seen that, I'll check it out. | User: Have a good day! | Recommender: You too! | User: Bye!\nUser: HI! Do you know of any good dramas? | Recommender: Yes I like Forrest Gump (1994) | User: I saw that a few times. Don't really care to see it again. | User: Anything else? | User: I likes Beaches  (1988) | Recommender: You should watch Nebraska  (2013) | User: Oh I haven't seen that is it good? | Recommender: It is very good | User: Do you have a couple more in case I don't like that? | Recommender: You should watch Ed  (1996) | User: Ok I'll try that one. | User: Do you know of any with Denzel Washington? | Recommender: Yes Man on Fire  (2004) | User: Oh is that the one with the little girl? | User: Sounds good I'll watch that one! Thanks! | User: bye!\nRecommender: Hello | Recommender: How are you? | User: Good I want to watch a movie with Johnny Depp | Recommender: Alright, sounds good to me! Have you seen Edward Scissorhands (1990) | Recommender: It's my all time favorite ;) | Recommender: Though, I must say it is a tie with Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas  (1998) | User: Yeah it's a great movie | User: I will watch that | User: Great idea | Recommender: Alright, great! I've got a couple more for you, if you want to start a list ;) | Recommender: I would definitely check out Blow  (2001) and Sweeney Todd: The Demon Barber of Fleet Street  (2007) | Recommender: Both of those are go-to's when I just cannot find something to watch, and I'm sure you'll like them! | User: Ok great all great picks | User: I will watch\n######################\nOutput:", "role":
