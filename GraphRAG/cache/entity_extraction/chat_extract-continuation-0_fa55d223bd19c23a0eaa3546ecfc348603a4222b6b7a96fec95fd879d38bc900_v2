Well some that I can think of like it are Cabin Fever  (2000) and The Conjuring (2013) | User: I actually wanted to see both of those and forgot about them. Now that you've reminded me I can actually watch them. | User: Thank you so much. | Recommender: Another horror movie that I loved was It Follows (2014) very good one. | User: I remember the previews for that. Its another one that looked good and I lost track. Thanks. | Recommender: You're welcome, hope you have a great night. | User: You too!\nRecommender: Hello. | User: Hi | Recommender: anything in particular you're looking for? | User: I was thinking about a good mystery movie? | User: Do you know of any? | User: I liked Sherlock Holmes  (2009) | Recommender: I'm thinking. I want to make sure I'm not mixing up thriller with mystery as they aren't the same thing. | User: I love both | User: thriller is even better | User: Especially psychological thrillers | Recommender: Have you ever seen Zodiac  (2007) It had an interesting story line | User: No, is that about the serial killer? | Recommender: Yes. | User: I love a good serial killer movie | Recommender: The Silence of the Lambs  (1991)  was a great movie. | User: Yes I loved it | User: Red Dragon  (2002) was a good follow up | Recommender: You have probably already watched the series then. How about The Game  (2010) ? | User: Haven't heard of that one, is it good? | Recommender: There are numerous movies with that name but the one I'm referring to is a mystery/thriller. | User: I need to check that out | Recommender: Yes. It stars Sean Penn and starts with a mystery gift exchange. | Recommender: Very unique plot. | User: He's quite the character, I'm sure I'll like all 3 of the ones you suggested.  Anything else you can think of? | Recommender: Memories of Murder (2003)  It is a little more graphic though. | User: Graphic is good.  Well I'm all set here then, off to the movies I go.  Nice talking with you and thanks.  Have a good night and bye. | Recommender: You too. Good night.\nRecommender: Good evening! | User: Hi there | User: im looking for a classic friend | Recommender: Classics, huh?  Okay, I think I can help with that. | User: yea something like Casablanca  (1942) | Recommender: Have you seen Gone with the Wind  (1939)? | Recommender: Or there's The Wizard of Oz  (1939).  I like that one a lot. | User: I haven | User: I haven't seen Gone with the Wind  (1939) | User: The Wizard of Oz  (1939) was great | User: what move is it like? | Recommender: I can't think of another movie that Gone with the Wind  (1939)  is like.  It's kind of in a class of its own.  Southern plantation, romance, drama, history.  It's epic. | User: Hmmm | Recommender: There's always Citizen Kane (1941).  Have you seen that one? | User: is it like Wild Wild West (1999) | User: Yes Citizen Kane (1941) was great | User: is Gone with the Wind  (1939) like that | Recommender: No, I don't think it's much like Wild Wild West (1999), although that was a good movie. | User: Cool | Recommender: Can I help you with anything else? | User: I'll have to check it out | User: thanks | Recommender: Okay, have a great night!\nUser: Hello. | Recommender: helo how can i help you? | User: I am interested in finding some different movie interests. Are you familiar with any horror or parody movies? | Recommender: have you tried Get Out (2017)  or Scary Movie 5 (2013) | Recommender: i cant belive there were 5 of those ... | User: I didn't know there was a fifth one. I'll have to check that out. | User: Me either. | Recommender: What about 10 Cloverfield Lane (2016) | User: It reminds of Final Destination 5 (2011) . It's always questionable when they will actually be at the 'final.' | Recommender: lol | User: I have seen that. It was very good. | Recommender: well the first Scary Movie (2000) had to be at least decent, for a parody.  otherwise why make 4 mre? | User: Yes. I liked it. I just didn't expect so many of them. | Recommender: well  good luck with the fifth one.  apparently they found a decent formula | User: Thank you very much. Have a good night.\nUser: Hi im looking for an exciting movie | Recommender: Hey!
