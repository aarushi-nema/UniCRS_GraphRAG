(1965) | Recommender: They star in it, it contains many musical interjections, and very funny dialogue. | Recommender: Did you enjoy Yellow Submarine  (1968) ? | User: It was okay. A bit weird, but I enjoyed the music. I'll definitely have to check out Help!  (1965). | Recommender: If you are looking for something less &quot;cheeky&quot; and more about the band themselves, I would recommend The Beatles: Eight Days a Week | User: Oh is that the documentary? I've been meaning to watch that. | Recommender: Yes, Ron Howard produced it, so you KNOW it's got to be good! | User: Yes he's awesome! I loved A Beautiful Mind  (2001).
