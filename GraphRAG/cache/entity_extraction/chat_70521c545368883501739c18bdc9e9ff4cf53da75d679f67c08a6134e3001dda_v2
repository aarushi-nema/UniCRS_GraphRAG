Who's in that one? | Recommender: Katherine Heigl | User: Hmmm.  I don't love her...  Doesn't Woody Allen have a new movie out? | Recommender: Yes! It's called Wonder Wheel (2017) | User: How are the ratings on that one? | User: I mean the reviews | Recommender: 3/5 | Recommender: They aren't all too great | User: Okay. Well, I'm satisfied with these suggestions... | User: Thanks! | Recommender: What's a movie that you liked? | Recommender: Don't go | User: Okay.  Let's see.  I liked Four Weddings and a Funeral. | Recommender: It's not done! | Recommender: Tag it! | Recommender: Four Weddings and a Funeral (1994) | Recommender: There we go\nUser: Hi! What movies do you recommend from 2017? | Recommender: Hey what kind of movies are you interested in? I like Romance movies if your into those and I suggest Titanic  (1997)  its a classic! Have you already seen it? If so did you like it? | User: I was not a Titanic  (1997) fan. Have you seen Ladybird, Ladybird  (1994) | User: The tear is wrong because it was not in the drop down menu. | User: Year. | User: Lady Bird  (2017) ! | Recommender: I have not seen Ladybird, Ladybird  (1994) what's it about? What do you think about A Walk to Remember (2002) or The Notebook (2004)? Do you think those are some good suggestions? | User: We have very different tastes. I have just decided I am not a Romance movie kinda gal after all. | Recommender: Ok what no problem what types of movies do you like? | Recommender: Sorry didn't mean to say what I meant to say no problem what kind of movies do you like and I will do my best to make a selection. | User: I love documentaries or innovative film making. | Recommender: Have you seen The Diary of Anne Frank  (1959) I think that's an amazing documentary and I saw it when I was in Middle School. I think its a good recommendation. | User: YES! I loved The Diary of Anne Frank  (1980) . I named my daughter after her. | Recommender: Wow that's awesome! I love The Diary of Anne Frank  (1959)  Also Food, Inc. (2008) if your more so into the behind the scene about what's happening with our food. | User: Food, Inc. (2008) was excellent. Did you see Blackfish  (2013) ? | Recommender: I have not seen Blackfish  (2013) but I am going to add it to my list of movies I would like to see. | User: I highly recommend it! What have you seen recently that you liked? | Recommender: The last movie I saw was the The BFG  (2016) and I thought it was a good movie but my kids thought it was kind of creepy lol | User: I remember reading that to my daughter. We loved the books --all of his books.I think we should say good-bye? | Recommender: Ok did you mention at least 4 movies? I just want to make sure before we abort conversation. | User: I thought it was 4 total. Am I incorrect? | Recommender: My yellow comments at the top say &quot;You and your partner must mention at least 4 movies&quot; | User: Ok, I can recommend Citizen Kane (1941) as one of the penultimate classics! | User: And always Tootsie for 1980's fun. | Recommender: We really do have different movie taste lol I have never seen Citizen Kane (1941) and I will definetly check out Tootsie Thanks for the suggestion and It was nice talking to you. | User: This was lovely. Have a great day. Bye!\nUser: Good morning! | Recommender: Hi! What type of movies do you prefer&gt; | User: I'm looking for something scary.  Blood and gore is okay, but I'd rather have a good story than a good slasher film. | Recommender: Ok. Hmm. This is a bit difficult for me. I could suggest Mother! (2017) although I did not like it. | User: Mother! (2017) looked good, what did you not like about it? | Recommender: Very disjointed in a way that I found boring. I was wondering if my younger self would have found it profound. However, I can always throw back to The Shining  (1980). Or Psycho  (1960) | Recommender: I am not that old. | User: Ohh....those are good ones.  I'm watching The Purge: Anarchy (2014) right now and it's horrible. | Recommender: A bad movie can be fun. And a good documentary like Blackfish  (2013)  can be frightening. | User: I'll definitely check that one out! | Recommender: How about The Blair Bitch Project (1999) ? Did you see that? Sadly, I din't think the creators went on to much success with other films. | Recommender: Yikes. The drop down menu has that misspelled! | User: Ehh....I lived in a small town when The Blair Witch Project (1999) came out and by the time it made it to our theater\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}], "parameters": {"model": "gpt-3.5-turbo", "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "temperature": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0}}}
