Saw it in 3d and it blew me away. I haven't seen a 3d movie since that could compare. | User: same. i dont think they offer 3d movies much anymore. | Recommender: There are. But of course you don't care for superhero films. | User: i wont say that. just not a fan of them but i watched Avengers: Age of Ultron (2015) and i liked it. wasnt as cheesy as other films | Recommender: LOVED that movie. I'm so looking forward to @Avengers Infiniti War | User: yah. me too. | User: and @Black Panther. | Recommender: Me too. So you DO have a fondness for superheros. lol | User: some, ya, but not many | User: i cant stand the Iron Man  (2008) . none of them | Recommender: The first two were great. The third, not so much. It felt like they did it for the sake of doing it. | User: yah. I kinda feel that way about Thor: Ragnarok (2017)  and Thor: The Dark World | Recommender: Well to be fair, those have a place in the cinematic universe. not so much with Iron Man 3 | User: what do you mean? | Recommender: I'll tell you next round. This HITs complete. | Recommender: :)\nUser: Hi could you help me find a movie? | Recommender: War for the Planet of the Apes (2017) was really good I just watched it the other night. | User: I don't think I'd like something like that. Could you maybe recommend a comedy? | User: Maybe something like Get Hard (2015) | Recommender: Have you seen Why Him%3F (2016)? It has James Franco and Bryan Cranston | Recommender: Pretty funny came out a year or so ago | User: No, I haven't seen that one. I like both of those actors, so I'd probably like that | User: Any others that you'd recommend? | Recommender: Daddy's Home  (2015)  is one you'd probably like and the sequel comes out soon | User: Oh ok, I do remember seeing that trailer. Thanks I will try those two! | Recommender: Or claasic Adam Sandler movies like Happy Gilmore (1996) | User: Haha I do love that one | Recommender: And no problem. I dont watch too many comedy movies so I just threw out ones with certain actors lol | User: Your suggestions were great I appreciate the help thanks! | User: Have a good day\nRecommender: Hi can i help you find a good movie today? | Recommender: what are your likes and dislikes | User: Yeah, do you have any drama or horror recommendations? | User: Yeah, do you have any drama or horror recommendations? | User: I'll watch anything though honestly | Recommender: Yes! horror is my favorite. Have you seen The Devil's Rejects (2005) by Rob Zombie? | Recommender: also, Unfaithful  (2002) is a good drama, thriller | User: I've seen The Devil's Rejects (2005) and it's great. Never seen Unfaithful  (2002) though. | Recommender: You might ike that one. it has Richard Gere and Diane Lane. also What Lies Beneath (2000) is one you may like | User: Oh nice. I think I've heard of that but never seen it either. | Recommender: cool, try those out. what is your favorite horror movie? | User: Overall? Probably can't pick a single one but I loved the new It  (2017) even though it wasn't scary, and then the original A Nightmare on Elm Street (1984) | User: And The Babadook (2014) was different but good. | Recommender: those are both really good, i love the Freddy Kruegar films. he is my favorite. I will hvave to check out. The Babadook (2014) | User: It's strange, not really a typical horror movie but its interesting for sure. | Recommender: nice i will look it up | Recommender: thanks have  a good day\nUser: What movie would you recommend for an action movie i can watch with my family? | Recommender: I would maybe start with Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom (1984) | Recommender: I like romantic movies.  What do you think I could watch with my husband for a date night at home? | User: My wife likes You've Got Mail (1998) .  She watches it at least once a year. | Recommender: Ok thank you for the advice! | User: You're welcome.  My kids really  like Star Wars.  What other type of movie do you think they might like? | Recommender: Maybe go with an 80's classic if they like the old Star wars movies.  Have they seen The Goonies (1985) | User: No actually- and they would like that one ! | Recommender: ok Great! | Recommender: my teenager likes scary movies that arent gory.  Any advice for that genre? | User: Hmm.  that is a tricky one.  I don't really know:( | User: But maybe she would like a thriller like The Silence of the Lambs  (1991) | Recommender: I will try that. Thanks | User: OK:)  I think we are good here? | Recommender: yeah.
