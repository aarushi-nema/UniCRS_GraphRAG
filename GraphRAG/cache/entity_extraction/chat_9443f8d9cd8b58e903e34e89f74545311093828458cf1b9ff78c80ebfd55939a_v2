Such as Mrs. Doubtfire (1993) ? | Recommender: That is probably the funnies movie I've ever seen | User: Yes Robin Williams is a good actor. I liked him in The Angriest Man in Brooklyn (2014) | Recommender: I haven't seen that one! is that a comedy or more of a drama? | User: It's sort of a drama but with a lot of comedy thrown in. | Recommender: That sounds like my type of movie! | User: I enjoyed it. | Recommender: I hope I've helped you find something! | User: Thanks! I appreciate the help!\nRecommender: Hi | User: Hello | Recommender: What would you like to watch? | User: I like superhero, adventure and mystery. | Recommender: How about Thoracocare | Recommender: Sorry Thor: Ragnarok (2017) | User: Yes, I'm looking forward to seeing that one! Sounds good. | Recommender: The Avengers  (2012) | User: I still have to also watch Wonder Woman  (2017). I heard it's good. | User: I did enjoy that one. | Recommender: The Dark Knight Trilogy | Recommender: The best Batman so far. | Recommender: Justice League  (2017) | Recommender: But I didn’t really like it though. | User: yes, they are all really good movies. It's a lot of story lines to keep up with though! | User: Thanks for the suggestions! | Recommender: Well I hope I help. Bye | User: Bye\nRecommender: Hi! | User: hi | User: What kind of movies do you like? | User: I like comedies. | Recommender: Comedy movies are very entertaining. | Recommender: I enjoyed Snatched (2017) recently. Also Daddy's Home 2 (2017) is very entertaining | User: I have never seen the second one. | User: The first one is hilarious | Recommender: Also I enjoyed Baywatch  (2017). It's overly complicated plot wise but can be pretty fun. | User: I haven't seen that one either. | User: The last one that I saw was The Chef  (2012) | User: That was both a cute and funny movie. | Recommender: I haven't seen that one myself. | User: I think that I want to see Daddy's Home 2 (2017). the first one is great. | User: Oh the movie is about a man that reconnects with his son through his food truck escapades. | Recommender: Cool maybe I'll check it out. | User: Thank you for your suggestions! | User: Bye.\nRecommender: Hello! I love recommending movies. Is there anything I can help you with? | User: Sure can! | User: I'm in the mood for a good murder mystery | User: Time period doesn't matter. A good movie is a good movie. :) | Recommender: The best by far is Anatomy of a Murder (1959) . It is a timeless classic that will have you on the edge of your seat | Recommender: Or The Silence of the Lambs  (1991) but I'm sure you've probably seen that one | User: Okay. Can you give me a quick synopsis? Is it anything like A Perfect Murder (1998) ? | User: And yes, I have seen The Silence of the Lambs  (1991). I loved it. :) | Recommender: The Anatomy of Murder is a trial of a murder mystery with Duke Ellington and Jimmy Stewart | User: I love the Duke, lol | Recommender: I haven't seen A perfect Murder so I can't really compare the two | Recommender: There's also The Bone Collector (1999) . I actually just saw it the other day. I was happily surprised with how tasteful it is | User: With Denzel? That is a very good movie. Reminds me of Zodiac  (2007) with Jake Gylenhall | Recommender: Agreed. Both great mysteries that don't move too slow | Recommender: I hope I helped you find something! | Recommender: Have a great day and have a Happy New Year | User: Thanks you too!\nUser: Hi there! How are you today? | Recommender: I'm good. Very good. | Recommender: What sort of movies are you looking for today? | User: I'm in the mood for a good murder mystery. Time period doesn't matter, I just want to see something good. | Recommender: In that case, I would recommend Murder on the Orient Express (2017) with Johnny Depp and Daisy Ridley. | User: I haven't seen that. Is it based on the original story/film? | Recommender: It is. And it's just as good. | Recommender: I would also recommend The Snowman  (2017) with Michael Fassbender. It's sort of like Seven  (1995) where the cop plays a cat and mouse game with a serial killer | Recommender: I would also recommend The Prestige  (2006) with Christian Bale and Hugh JAckman. | User: Hmm, I think I might @The Snowman. What is The Prestige  (2006) about? | Recommender: It's about two magicians that\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}], "parameters": {"model": "gpt-3.5-turbo", "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "temperature": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0}}}
