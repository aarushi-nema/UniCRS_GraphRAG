Like a dark version of O Brother, Where Art Thou%3F (2000) or at least the part where the guy sells his soul. | Recommender: haha. yeah! but that would be the only part. Think of Spawn  (1997) but before it was a thing | User: I loved that show. What was the main guys name, something with a Z&gt; | User: Well, I think that is all the movies I can handle for a while. Thank you so much!

I like a lot of them. | Recommender: Don't Breathe (2016) is good. | User: What about one like The Amityville Haunting (2011) ? | User: Well, I think I got enough to scare the pants off me for a while. | User: Goodbye and I really thank you for your help! | Recommender: No problem.\nUser: Oi Oi Ello! | Recommender: hello! | Recommender: What sort of movies are you into? | User: Well, Big on the comedy aspect I reckon.

Know any other right okay ones? | Recommender: I do not know what that means. | Recommender: Oh, maybe Juno (2007) | Recommender: Do you know any like that one? | User: That was an alright flick I reckon. Umm maybe 500 Days of Summer sort of reminds me of it there. | Recommender: I did not see that one. | Recommender: It has the girl from Elf  (2003)  right? | Recommender: If you like that one, I would go for something like Superbad  (2007) | User: Haha, Ive actually never seen Elf  (2003) . Loved Superbad  (2007) bit overplayed now for me at this point though. | Recommender: Or even Mr. Mom (1983) if you are into the 80's | Recommender: Ahh, maybe 21 Jump Street  (2012) ? | User: Both good flicks there.

Share you wisdom of sci-fi movies please. | Recommender: A person with great taste, I can recommend you last years Blade Runner 2049 (2017) , but you should definitely see the very first movie of it which was Blade Runner (1982) | User: I have seen neither. | User: Are they very big on lore? | Recommender: Yes, they sure are, and if you're a big fan of getting to know the movie or appreciating the movie by your own speculations and analysis, I would recommend both. | Recommender: But if you want something more casual but still Sci fi, Cowboy Bebop: The Movie (2001) is a movie I would recommend, although animated, space adventure with a bunch of bounty hunters is simply good. | User: I have never saw that one either! | User: The name reminds me of Blazing Saddles (1974) | Recommender: Lol, go see all of them my friend, well that's it, hope you have a good one! | User: Thank you so much I will\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}], "parameters": {"model": "gpt-3.5-turbo", "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "temperature": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0}}}
