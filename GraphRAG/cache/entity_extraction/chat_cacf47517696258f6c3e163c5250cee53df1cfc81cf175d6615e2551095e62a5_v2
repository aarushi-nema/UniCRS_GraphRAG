Maybe something very 90's like Empire Records (1995). | User: We watched that the other day at work in honor of Rex Manning day. | Recommender: Hmm, let me think for a second ;) | Recommender: How about The Baby-Sitters Club  (1995)? | User: Oh that is a good suggestion. I haven't seen it in ages. | Recommender: Same here! | Recommender: Another that comes to mind is Reality Bites (1994) | User: Or Clueless  (1995) . I don't think it gets more 90's then that. | Recommender: True! Clueless  (1995) is pretty timeless too in a way! | Recommender: Always makes me think of Mean Girls (2004) | User: This conversation has gotten me so nostalgic.\nRecommender: Hello! | User: Hi! | Recommender: Can I recommend some flicks for you to watch? | User: Yes! | Recommender: Alright! | User: I like action and romantic comedies. | Recommender: Okay, how about This Means War  (2012) :-) | User: That's a good one! | User: I like the cast in it. | Recommender: Or even The Bounty Hunter  (2010)! | Recommender: Same here, it really made it all come together! | User: I haven't seen that. Who is in that one? | Recommender: Gerald butler, I'm horrible with names so I had to look lol | Recommender: Jennifer Aniston | User: No worries! He's good.

He's in so much, but names....just escape me lol | User: I used to be good at names, but not now. | Recommender: Also check out Knight and Day (2010) ;) | Recommender: Same here...scares me, I'm only 27 :P | User: I haven't seen that one, but I've heard it's pretty good. It has Tom Cruise right? I'm not the biggest Tom Cruise fan, but I heard it was good. | Recommender: I don't recall him in it...steve carell and tina fey are the leads though! | Recommender: He may be though, it's been about 6 or 7 years since I saw it | User: Are you thinking about Date Night (2010)? | Recommender: Yes, I am! | User: I think they are in that one. I may be wrong though. | Recommender: Oh my :P | User: Okay! I have seen that one, but not the Tom Cruise one! | Recommender: I really am slipping I suppose! | User: Ha! It's Thursday! | Recommender: I haven't seen the tom cruise one either now that I look, I guess I just got the names swapped around | Recommender: Yeah, I'll go with that ;) | User: Well.

I really am out of the loop. | Recommender: I had been until we got tv service, seeing previews again gave me the movie theater itch lol | User: Isn't Deadpool 2  (2018) coming out soon. I think that is what I will see next. | Recommender: That is one that's right up there for me too!
