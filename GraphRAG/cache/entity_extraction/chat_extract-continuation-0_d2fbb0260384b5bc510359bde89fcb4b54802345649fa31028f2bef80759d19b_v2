We watch at least one a week! | Recommender: I usually stop Star Wars: Episode I – The Phantom Menace (1999) because they kind of can't stand up to the others. | Recommender: I watch them less often. Another great one is the The Lord of the Rings  trilogy | User: Well they're not really the same.  The new ones aren't written by Lucas anymore I don't think | Recommender: I don't think so either. Byt The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring (2001) is an amazing film. | User: The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring (2001) is classic and amazing I agree | User: Thanks for the list!  It was nice talking to another classic Star wars nut!\nRecommender: Hi there what kind of movies do you like to watch? | User: Hey, any comedy recommendations? | Recommender: Maybe Sausage Party ?  It's actually pretty funny | User: I started it, It's no kids movie for sure. | Recommender: No it's certainly not but then most modern comedies aren't.  Bad Moms (2016)  for example | User: I think I ended up watching Date Night (2010) instead. | User: Is Bad Moms (2016) any good? | Recommender: I've seen that!  I liked it.  Oooh and 50 First Dates (2004) | Recommender: It really is a good movie but it does have non kid stuff in it | User: Yeah, that's a good one, one of the few Adam Sandler films I liked. | Recommender: Yeah I thought that one was really sweet | Recommender: I hope I could help a little bit anyway! | User: It was out of character for him, he should only do those kind of films. | User: You did, thanks. Bye. | Recommender: Thanks!\nUser: Hi, any comedies to recommend? | Recommender: Are you interested in knowing already released or pending release movies? | User: Something older, not this year. | Recommender: Can you give me your age range? | User: Anything from the 50's to the 90's will work for me. | Recommender: Do you have any rating preferences?  Meaning do you mind if the comedy is R or would you prefer PG/G? | User: not really. | User: What was the last movie you watched? | Recommender: From the 90's, I would recommend something with Adam Sandler like Billy Madison (1995) | Recommender: or Office Space (1999) | User: I haven't seen that one. Is it any good? | User: Office Space (1999) is a really good movie. I saw a mobile game for it the other day and couldn't believe it's almost 20 years old. | Recommender: I am a Adam Sandler or Vince Vaughn or Bill Murray fan.  You really can't go wrong with anything they're in.  However, I wouldn't watch them with younger children. | Recommender: I know!  I had to check the date myself. | User: The last Adam Sandler movie I saw was Pixels  (2015). I really liked that. | Recommender: I didn't care for Pixels  (2015) too much, but it was well made. | User: I like Peter Dinklage, and Josh Gad in that one. | Recommender: If you're interested in something a little more recent, I would recommend: Sisters  (2015) | Recommender: Tammy  (2014) | User: I'll check those out. thanks. | Recommender: The Internship (2013) | Recommender: You're welcome - have a good day! | User: You too!\nRecommender: Hey! | Recommender: What type of movies are you interested in? | User: Hi there!

I loved that show as well as the books it came from | Recommender: It's a classic | Recommender: Alice Through the Looking Glass  (2016) was pretty Good!
