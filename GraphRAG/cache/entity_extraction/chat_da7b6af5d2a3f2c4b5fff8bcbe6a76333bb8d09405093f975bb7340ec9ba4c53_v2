I'm here to help you with a movie if you're interested. | User: I need some suggestions on Bollywood movies. | Recommender: Okay great.  That's awesome.  One moment. | User: I saw Raees  (2016) and enjoyed it. | Recommender: Do you want a newer movie or one you can watch at home on a DVD? | User: At home please. | Recommender: I haven't seen any Bollywood movies but have heard of some. | Recommender: Murder  (2004) was supposed to be good as well as Budget Padmanabhan (2000) | User: I didn't watch Murder, wasn't appealing to me. | Recommender: I'm sorry about that. Let me give you another one. | User: I did see Budget Padmanabhan and liked it. | Recommender: I found Pari  (1995) does that one appeal to you? | User: That is a good movie, I saw it a while ago. | Recommender: Okay.  How about Tiger Zinda Hai  (2017) it was from last year. | User: Haven't seen this one. I will check it out. | User: Thank you much. | Recommender: Sounds good.  I'm glad you liked it.

What is that about? | Recommender: I have not seen Superbad or the other, but I did see Bridesmaids and War Bride and liked them a lot. | User: What is The War Bride (2001) about? | Recommender: Two girls became rivals when they scheduled their wedding on the same day. | Recommender: Maybe you will like Girls Trip (2017), I know I did. | User: I haven't seen Girls Trip (2017) I may take a look. I think you might be confusing The War Bride (2001) with Bride Wars (2009). I saw that, it was okay. | Recommender: Oh, did you like Superbad? | User: Yes. | User: Thank you for your suggestions, goodbye! | Recommender: Oh yes you are correct, sorry once again. | Recommender: I hope I helped out. Good bye.\nRecommender: Hello. | Recommender: What can I help you with today? | User: Hhi | User: I'm looking for a movie to watch tonight. | Recommender: Is there any genre you enjoy or are you looking for anything?
