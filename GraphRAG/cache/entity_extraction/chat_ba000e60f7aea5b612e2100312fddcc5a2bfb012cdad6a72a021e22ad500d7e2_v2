Can you recommend a good anime for me? | Recommender: Anime or animated movies? Kind of a difference there. | User: Anime. No Cars 3  (2017) or pixar movies or nothing like that | Recommender: You want a single film or multiple? If the latter I would suggest Ghost in the Shell  (1995) and it's subsequent titles | User: Is that like Akira  (1988) ? | Recommender: No, but it does discuss politics and societal norms like it. It's more of a philosophical/political drama | Recommender: still really good.
