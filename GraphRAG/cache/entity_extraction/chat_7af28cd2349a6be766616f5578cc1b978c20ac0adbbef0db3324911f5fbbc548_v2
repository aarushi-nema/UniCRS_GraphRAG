It's an old Tales from the Crypt film | User: I loved that show! I hoped they'd do a remake, but never got around to it. :( | Recommender: It was pretty hilarious, lol. The Crypt Keeper was hilarious. | User: Thanks for your help! Have a good morning!\nUser: Hello. Can you recommend a good movie to see in theaters this weekend? | Recommender: Sure! | Recommender: As a matter of fact, I watched Murder on the Orient Express (2017) just last night with my son. We loved it. | Recommender: It's as good as the original. | User: That's the one about the mystery on a train in the mountains? | Recommender: Yes, it is. Johnny Depp and Daisy Ridley are in it. | Recommender: If you're into superheros Justice League  (2017) and Thor: Ragnarok (2017) are pretty good as well. | User: That's the third Thor movie, right? | User: I haven't seen the second one yet. | Recommender: Thor: The Dark World is okay, but Ragnarok is definitely better. | Recommender: If you decide to see the third film, make sure to see the second first so you'll understand what's going on. | User: Gotcha! | Recommender: Also, you might also be interested in Spider-Man: Homecoming (2017) . It's not in theaters anymore, but a good film nonetheless. | Recommender: But if you definitely want something in theaters, try The Mountain Between Us (2017) . It's got Idris Elba and Kate Winslet and is very good. | User: Is it a romance? | Recommender: Sort of. It's about two strangers who find themselves stranded on a mountain after their plane crashes. A romance builds from their struggles. | User: Sounds interesting. | User: Thanks for your help my friend. It's been a pleasure. | Recommender: Like wise.\nUser: Hey. Can you recommend some good new science fiction films? Preferably something already on DVD that I can buy or rent to watch online. | Recommender: Sure thing. Have you seen Star Wars: The Force Awakens (2015) ? | User: lol, I have. Who hasn't | Recommender: Good point. :) | Recommender: What about Passengers  (2016) with Jennifer Laawrence and Chris Pratt? | User: No, what's that about? | Recommender: A guy (Pratt) is awakened prematurely on an interstellar space trip, and wakes up another passenger (Lawrence) for company. Meanwhile the ship is in danger of falling apart and they have to figure out why. | User: Sounds melodramatic. | Recommender: It is. But it's still an okay movie. | Recommender: If that sounds too slow, try Life  (2017) with Jake Gylenhal and Ryan Reynolds. It's a dark film about an alien life form from Mars. | User: Yeah, that's more my speed. :) | Recommender: In that case, also try The Thing  (2011) . It's not a remake of the original, it's a prequel. It tells the story of what happened to the Norwegians before the dog shows up at the US camp | User: Oh okay. I never watched it because I thought it was a remake of the original. | Recommender: Nope. Entirelly different story. | Recommender: Also, check out Pandorum (2009) with Dennis Quaid and Ben Foster. Very similar to Passengers but much darker and no romance. | User: I'll check them out. And they're all on DVD? | Recommender: Sure are. :) | User: Thanks man, you've been great. :)\nUser: Hi friend. Can you recommend some good classic movies? | Recommender: Sure! But by classic do you mean before the 70s or after? | User: After | Recommender: Okay, How about Indecent Proposal (1993) ? Demi Moor and Woodie Harrleson. | User: No, too risque for me | Recommender: Okay, what about Sleepless in Seattle (1993) ? Hanks and Ryan? | User: That's more my speed. It's been a while since I've seen it though. | Recommender: That's okay. Nothing wrong with that. Have you seen All the Right Moves  (1983) with Tom Cruise? | User: Sadly I haven't. Is it good? | Recommender: Yes. If you liked Ferris Bueller's Day Off (1986) you'll like this one. | Recommender: And while we're on Cruise, what about Days of Thunder (1990) ? | User: No, never seen that either. | Recommender: It's a really great film. You'll love it. Kind of like Regarding Henry (1991) but with race cars. | User: Sounds good. Well thanks for the suggestions. I'm going to see which ones are on Netflix to watch later today. | Recommender: Have fun!\nRecommender: Hello there! What kind of movies are you looking for? | User: I'm looking for a good comedic drama. Something along the lines of The Family Stone (2005) . | User: I love Diane Keaton. :) | Recommender: Ok. How about Love Actually (2003) ? | User: I don't recall\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}], "parameters": {"model": "gpt-3.5-turbo", "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "temperature": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0}}}
