I'm looking for a comedy | User: Maybe something like Dumb and Dumber (1994) | Recommender: How about Bad Moms (2016)? It's a great movie! | User: I haven't seen that one. What's it about? | Recommender: It's an uplifting comedy about the crazy, hectic lives about a group of moms. | Recommender: Have you seen Dumb and Dumber To (2014) ? | User: That sounds good. No, I haven't seen the sequel. Is it any good? | Recommender: It's decent. Hall Pass is by far the funniest one I've seen. | User: I haven't seen that one either. What's it about? | Recommender: Two men are having issues in their marriages and their wives give them a hall pass to do whatever they want for a week. | User: Oh I bet that's hilarious! | Recommender: Also, Liar Liar (1997) isn't they newest movie out there, but it's similar to Dumb and Dumber (1994) . | User: Yeah I really like Liar Liar (1997). Thanks for the suggestions. They were great. | Recommender: Thanks! Have a great evening! | User: You too\nRecommender: Hello! | User: Hello, I'm looking for a rom com. | Recommender: Romantic comedy, right? | User: Yes, maybe something like Splash  (1984) | Recommender: Have you seen the prequel, Splash, Too (1988) ? | User: No, I haven't. I'd probably love it, though. | Recommender: I'm sure you would! Perfect Sense (2011) is definitely a thriller. It's more of a romantic drama, but it's still good. | User: I haven't seen it, either. What's it about? | Recommender: A chef and a scientist fall in love, and then there's an epidemic that takes people's sensory perceptions. Great movie. | User: Ooh that sounds right up my alley. | Recommender: The Curious Case of Benjamin Button  (2008) would be a good one too! | User: I haven't seen that one, but I remember the previews for it, and it looked really good. | Recommender: Hm, how about The Time Traveler's Wife  (2009) ? | User: I've seen bits and pieces of it, and I really liked it | Recommender: It's really a touching movie. | User: It is. Thanks for the suggestions | Recommender: You're welcome!\nRecommender: Hi, how are you doing? | User: Hello, I'm good. I'm looking for a drama. | Recommender: Hm, any specific type of drama? | User: Maybe something along the lines of Gran Torino (2008) | User: Not too much action | Recommender: Million Dollar Baby (2004) is an amazing movie. She's got something to prove and that makes it a good watch. | User: I haven't seen that one, yet. | User: The previews looked good, though | Recommender: It's a good movie. Invictus  (2009) is another good one and it was directed by the same man that directed Gran Torino (2008) | User: I haven't seen that one, either. But I like anything with Clint Eastwood | Recommender: So is Hereafter  (2010) | Recommender: Clint Eastwood directed that one too! | User: I haven't that one, but I'll definitely have to check them out | Recommender: The last one I have for you is Dirty Harry (1971). It's a bit older, but it's still got a solid plot. | User: I haven't seen that one, but I've heard great things about it. | User: Thanks for the suggestions! | Recommender: No problem, hope I helped a little bit! | User: It did. Bye!\nRecommender: Hello! | User: Hello! | User: I'm looking for an animated movie. | User: It can be classic or modern | Recommender: Hm, similar to Disney movies or more on the Anime side? | User: Disney | Recommender: Gotcha. My all time favorite is Bambi (1942), it's a classic Disney movie that everybody knows. | User: That one makes me cry, but it's so good. | Recommender: I know, right? Great movie. Have you seen The Iron Giant (1999) ? | User: I haven't seen that. What's it about? | Recommender: A young boy befriends a giant robot from outer space that the government wants to destroy. I remember watching it when I was maybe 5 years old! | User: Ooh that sounds interesting | Recommender: It is. 101 Dalmatians  (1996) is one of the best Disney movies out there, second to Bambi (1942) of course. | Recommender: Up  (2009) is also a great one! | User: I loved Up  (2009) I haven't seen 101 Dalmatians  (1996) though | Recommender: 101 Dalmatians  (1996) is a great family movie to watch! Fantasia (1940) is a really old one, but nonetheless it's still another great movie. It's more of a musical though. | Recommender: I hope I helped you a little bit! | User: I didn't really care for Fantasia (1940) when I was little\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>DUMB AND DUMBER (1994)<|>MOVIE<|>A 1994 comedy movie about two dimwitted friends on a road trip)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>BAD MOMS (2016)<|>MOVIE<|>A 2016 comedy movie about a group of moms navigating their hectic lives)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>DUMB AND DUMBER TO (2014)<|>MOVIE<|>A 2014 comedy movie, sequel to Dumb and Dumber (1994))\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>HALL PASS<|>MOVIE<|>A comedy movie about two men given a week off from marriage responsibilities)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>LIAR LIAR (1997)<|>MOVIE<|>A 1997 comedy movie starring Jim Carrey)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SPLASH (1984)<|>MOVIE<|>A 1984 romantic comedy movie about a mermaid)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SPLASH, TOO (1988)<|>MOVIE<|>A 1988 TV movie, sequel to Splash (1984))\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>PERFECT SENSE (2011)<|>MOVIE<|>A 2011 romantic drama movie about a chef and a scientist during an epidemic)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>THE CURIOUS CASE OF BENJAMIN BUTTON (2008)<|>MOVIE<|>A 2008 fantasy drama movie about a man aging in reverse)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>THE TIME TRAVELER'S WIFE (2009)<|>MOVIE<|>A 2009 romantic drama movie about a man with a genetic disorder that causes time travel)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>GRAN TORINO (2008)<|>MOVIE<|>A 2008 drama movie about a retired auto worker and his Hmong neighbors)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>MILLION DOLLAR BABY (2004)<|>MOVIE<|>A 2004 sports drama movie about a female boxer)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>INVICTUS (2009)<|>MOVIE<|>A 2009 biographical sports drama movie about Nelson Mandela and the South African rugby team)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>HEREAFTER (2010)<|>MOVIE<|>A 2010 fantasy drama movie directed by Clint Eastwood)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>DIRTY HARRY (1971)<|>MOVIE<|>A 1971 crime thriller movie starring Clint Eastwood)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>BAMBI (1942)<|>MOVIE<|>A 1942 animated drama movie about a young deer growing up in the forest)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>THE IRON GIANT (1999)<|>MOVIE<|>A 1999 animated science fiction movie about a boy and a giant robot)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>101 DALMATIANS (1996)<|>MOVIE<|>A 1996 animated adventure movie about a litter of dalmatian puppies)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>UP (2009)<|>MOVIE<|>A 2009 animated comedy-adventure movie about an elderly man and a young boy on a journey)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>FANTASIA (1940)<|>MOVIE<|>A 1940 animated musical movie featuring classical music and animation)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>DUMB AND DUMBER (1994)<|>COMEDY<|>Dumb and Dumber (1994) is a comedy movie)<|>\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>BAD MOMS (2016)<|>COMEDY<|>Bad Moms (2016) is a comedy movie)<|>\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>DUMB AND DUMBER TO (2014)<|>COMEDY<|>Dumb and Dumber To (2014) is a comedy movie)<|>\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>HALL PASS<|>COMEDY<|>Hall Pass is a comedy movie)<|>\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>LIAR LIAR (1997)<|>COMEDY<|>Liar Liar (1997) is a comedy movie)<|>\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>SPLASH (1984)<|>ROM COM<|>Splash (1984) is a romantic comedy movie)<|>\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>SPLASH, TOO (1988)<|>ROM COM<|>Splash, Too (1988) is a romantic comedy movie)<|>\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>PERFECT SENSE (2011)<|>ROM COM<|>Perfect Sense (2011) is a romantic comedy movie)<|>\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>THE CURIOUS CASE OF BENJAMIN BUTTON (2008)<|>ROM COM<|>The Curious Case of Benjamin Button (2008) is a romantic comedy movie)<|>\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>THE TIME TRAVELER'S WIFE (2009)<|>ROM COM<|>The Time Traveler's Wife (2009) is a romantic comedy movie)<|>\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>GRAN TORINO (2008)<|>DRAMA<|>Gran Torino (2008) is a drama movie)<|>\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>MILLION DOLLAR BABY (2004)<|>DRAMA<|>Million Dollar Baby (2004) is a drama movie)<|>\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>INVICTUS (2009)<|>DRAMA<|>Invictus (2009) is a drama movie)<|>\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>HEREAFTER (2010)<|>DRAMA<|>Hereafter (2010) is a drama movie)<|>\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>DIRTY HARRY (1971)<|>DRAMA<|>Dirty Harry (1971) is a drama movie)<|>\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>BAMBI (1942)<|>ANIMATED<|>Bambi (1942) is an animated movie)<|>\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>THE IRON GIANT (1999)<|>ANIMATED<|>The Iron Giant (1999) is an animated movie)<|>\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>101 DALMATIANS (1996)<|>ANIMATED<|>101 Dalmatians (1996) is an animated movie)<|>\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>UP (2009)<|>ANIMATED<|>Up (2009) is an animated movie)<|>\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>FANTASIA (1940)<|>ANIMATED<|>Fantasia (1940) is an animated movie)<|>\n<|COMPLETE|>"}, {"content": "MANY entities and relationships were missed in the last extraction.
