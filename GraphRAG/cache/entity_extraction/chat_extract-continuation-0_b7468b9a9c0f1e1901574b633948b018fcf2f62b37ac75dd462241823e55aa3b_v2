A Knight's Tale (2001) was my favorite of his | Recommender: Ooh Hitch  (2005) is really good if you're a Will Smith fan. | User: I love that movie!! That's one of my favorite with his! That movie is so under rated, but it's so good | User: Hitch  (2005) is really good, Will Smith was hilarious | Recommender: I hope you have some good options to choose from! | User: I do! Thank you so much!\nUser: Hey, I'm looking for a good film recommendation. | User: Maybe something action oriented like Dunkirk  (2017) | User: a war movie | Recommender: War Machine  is a great movie | User: What year did that release? | Recommender: its a recent movie came out this year 2017 | User: Is it a war movie like Dunkirk? | User: What about Tears of the Sun (2003) Is it anything like that? | Recommender: have you seen Stalingrad  (2013)  thats one of my all time favorite movies | User: I havent seen that.

I really like good action films, comedy, romance, and I also enjoy family movies with my family lol | Recommender: Sounds like you're into a bit of everything. :) Any preference for time period? | User: Not really it just all depends if the plot sounds good | Recommender: Since you like family oriented comedy, I'll suggest a few of my favorites of Bill Murray. Can't go wrong with Ghostbusters (1984) and The Jungle Book  (2016) . | Recommender: Though Murray only does a voice over in the second choice. | User: Both are good movies in fact I own  @TheJungleBook and I have seen Ghostbusters (1984) many times | Recommender: OH okay. Great then! What about Broken Flowers (2005) or Lost in Translation  (2003) ? They lean a little more to the adult in terms of theme, but are good in my opinion. | User: I haven't seen either of those but I will definitely have to check them out. The titles sound interesting | Recommender: I'm really fond of the second. Scarlet Johansson is in it. It's about 2 people who meet in Tokyo to produce a commercial but find love and solace in one another. | Recommender: And while we're on the subject of love, Her  (2013) starring Joaquin Phoenix is another good one | User: sounds pretty good. I will definitely have to check them out. Thanks :) | User: I do like Joaquin Phoenix. I will have to look that one up too | Recommender: Coincidentally it also stars Johansson but she only does a voice over of his love interest. | User: oh ok | Recommender: Guess that about covers it.
