How about @Romeo+Juliet? | User: I have seen that one. | Recommender: It's got the original dialogue (which can be hard to wade through), but the setting is an interesting take on the story. | Recommender: Okay then, how about Much Ado About Nothing  (2016) ? | User: I like Shakespeare as well. I would like something like Shakespeare in Love (1998) | User: Haven't seen that Much Ado About Nothing  (2016) | Recommender: It's Joss Whedon's take on the story. | Recommender: He filmed it at his house and brought in a lot of his regulars, but it was really good. | Recommender: The only thing I didn't like was the costuming and the black and white presentation made character identification confusing in the beginning. | Recommender: Otherwise, it's really good.  :) | User: Hmm, I might have to watch that one. Sounds interesting. | User: Any other ones that you might suggest? | Recommender: I LOVED Midnight in Paris (2011) .  It's Owen Wilson going through 1920's Paris, mingling with famous artists all while dealing with the demands of his 21st Century girlfriend. | User: I have seen that one. That was a good one. | Recommender: If you don't mind Kevin Smith, I recommend Chasing Amy (1997) . | User: I have seen that one. Thanks. | User: I think I am going to catch the two that you said that I haven't seen. Thank you. | Recommender: Sorry I couldn't offer more. | User: Not a problem. Thank you though. | Recommender: Any musicals you can recommend to me? | User: I only know of Grease  (1978) and Grease 2 (1982)  and Moulin Rouge! (2001) right off hand | Recommender: Moulin Rouge! (2001) has been on my list for a few years now. | Recommender: I saw a bit of it on YouTube.  I loved how they weaved contemporary songs into classic French cabaret. | Recommender: Thank you for the recommendation! | User: Yeah, I really like it. | User: You are welcome. And thank you. Have a good night. | Recommender: You too.  Happy watching!\nRecommender: Hello | User: Hello. How are you | Recommender: Good.

What else you got? | Recommender: What other genres are you into? Would help me out on what other movies to recommend | User: I love action and drama | Recommender: For drama I would say a movie that just came out that's good in my opinion is a movie called Lady Bird  (2017). It's a coming of age movie but filled with drama and some light hearted comedy | User: That one sounds good. | Recommender: For action I'm more into the superhero genre so if you somehow never seen one. Would definitely recommend a movie like the latest Thor: Ragnarok (2017) | User: I've sen that one and loved it | User: Thanks for those recommendations | Recommender: No problem! | User: Bye\nUser: Hi, I'd like to see a good action movie | User: Seen any good ones recently? | User: I saw The Fast and the Furious  (\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}], "parameters": {"model": "gpt-3.5-turbo", "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "temperature": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0}}}
