Did not like the whole hypnosis aspect. Reminded me a lot of Disturbing Behavior (1998). Have you seen that one? | Recommender: The last movie was Rampage (2018) and Deadpool 2  (2018) ool have you seen either one? | Recommender: No I never heard of that one | User: No I have not!

You too thanks!\nRecommender: Greetings | Recommender: How are you doing | User: Hello!  I'm good, I  hope you are well!  I would like to see a comedy.  Something irreverent, perhaps. | User: Something similar to Hangover (2010) maybe.  Definitely something more adult oriented. | Recommender: That was a good movie | Recommender: Have you seen any new movies lately | User: Yes.  I laughed so hard! | Recommender: Deadpool 2  (2018) | User: Oh, no, I haven't watched any out at the movie theater recently. | Recommender: The Avengers  (2012) | User: I haven't seen Deadpool 2.  That is a great suggestion. | Recommender: okay | User: Is I haven't seen Deadpool 2  (2018) , I mean. | User: I also haven't seen The Avengers  (2012) .

It is my favorite movie actually! I also really enjoyed The Basketball Diaries  (1995). Have you seen that? | Recommender: Also, an oldie but goodie would be What's Eating Gilbert Grape (1993) .  I think that movie was severely underrated.  Dicaprio was amazing in that role. | Recommender: I have seen The Basketball Diaries  (1995) .  It was good. | Recommender: Oh, my ALL TIME FAVORITE Dicaprio movie has to be Catch Me If You Can (2002) . | User: Oh yeah, those really good as well!
