Thanks for all your help! | Recommender: No problem! | User: Movie night will be a success! | User: Thanks again. Good bye!\nRecommender: Hello! | User: Hey. | User: Do you think you could help me find a good crime movie. My daughter loved The Call  (2013)  with Halle Berry | User: She tends to like more crime/mystery movies without too much sex or nudity. | Recommender: Ok cool, let me think about it for a minute. I haven't seen that but I know of some good ones like that. | User: My daughter is 17.  She also like Horror films. She loved It (1990) and the remake. | Recommender: Oh, nice, so has see seen Gone  (2012) | User: No i don't think she has. Who are the actors in that movie? | Recommender: They are sort of unknowns, it stars Amanda Seyfried. | User: Is it similar to Taken  (2008) with Liam Neilson? | Recommender: Yes, it is. | User: Oh good. that right up her alley! | User: I think she'll enjoy it! | User: Thanks for the suggestions! | Recommender: Awesome, that sounds like she will like it. It is also only rated PG-13 so it's not too graphic. | User: Thanks again! i really appreciate the help! | User: Have a great day! | Recommender: You too, good bye!\nUser: Hi! | User: I am looking for a suspensful movie | User: I recently watched Zodiac  (2007) and really liked it | Recommender: Suspense eh? Well fortunately you have plenty of options! | Recommender: Have you seen The Sixth Sense (1999) by any chance? I'd imagine you have, but it's always worth pointing out. | User: Oh i loved that movie | Recommender: Shutter Island  (2010) is another good one. | User: yeah I relaly liked that movie | Recommender: And of course you can't go wrong with The Shining  (1980). Or anything with Jack Nicholson for that matter. | User: oh thats a classic. | User: I love that movie | User: i need to rewatch that | User: thank you for your suggestions! | User: have a good day! | Recommender: Oh no problem. | Recommender: Glad I could help. you do the same!\nUser: Well, hello there! | Recommender: Hello, how are you? | User: I'm doing great. I just started listening to The Beatles recently and was looking for movies either starring the band or about them. | User: I have seen Yellow Submarine  (1968). | Recommender: I'm the perfect person to ask about this! I would highly recommend their movie Help!  (1965) | Recommender: They star in it, it contains many musical interjections, and very funny dialogue. | Recommender: Did you enjoy Yellow Submarine  (1968) ? | User: It was okay. A bit weird, but I enjoyed the music. I'll definitely have to check out Help!  (1965). | Recommender: If you are looking for something less &quot;cheeky&quot; and more about the band themselves, I would recommend The Beatles: Eight Days a Week | User: Oh is that the documentary? I've been meaning to watch that. | Recommender: Yes, Ron Howard produced it, so you KNOW it's got to be good! | User: Yes he's awesome! I loved A Beautiful Mind  (2001). Guess I'll be checking out The Beatles: Eight Days a Week later tonight. Thanks for the suggestion! | Recommender: You're welcome! I hope you enjoy it! | User: Thank you. Have a good one!\nUser: Hello! | Recommender: Hi | Recommender: What type of movie are you interested in | User: I'm looking for something funny. Similar to Monty Python and the Holy Grail (1975). | Recommender: Have you seen Blazing Saddles (1974) | User: I actually have not. Heard a lot of good things about it though. | Recommender: it's funny, a little dated, but not bad. | Recommender: History of the World, Part I (1981) is the same kind of funny. silly | Recommender: both are Mel Brooks movies | Recommender: do you have any other movies you like? | User: I haven't seen that either! I loved Spaceballs (1987) though, so Mel Brooks is probably a good director to focus on. | Recommender: definitely! | User: I also enjoy fun action movies like Guardians of the Galaxy  (2014) . | User: Anyway, I'll be watching History of the World, Part I (1981) and Blazing Saddles (1974) within the next couple days. Thanks for the suggestions! | Recommender: try Spider-Man: Homecoming (2017) | User: I loved that one. | Recommender: have a good day. | User: You do the same.\nRecommender: Hey! Hope the day is going well. Would you like to hear about some really good movies coming out soon? | User: Hello, yes I would! | Recommender: On e great choice is Jumanji  (2017) i with the Rock. | Recommender: This film is shocking with its amazing turn out at the box office right now. | User: I have heard of that - I know it's doing well\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}], "parameters": {"model": "gpt-3.5-turbo", "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "temperature": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0}}}
