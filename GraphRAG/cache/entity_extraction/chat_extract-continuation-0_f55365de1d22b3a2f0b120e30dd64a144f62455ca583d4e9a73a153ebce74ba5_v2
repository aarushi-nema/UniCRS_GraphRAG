Have you seen The Perfect Guy  (2015) ? | User: No, what's that about? | Recommender: It's a typical stalker/fatal attraction movie. Kind of like Obsessed  (2009) starring Beyonce and Morris Chestnut, but instead this time, a woman is being stalked. | Recommender: Another good choice is No Good Deed  (2014) with Idris Elba. It's like the other two as well. | User: Oh okay. Wow. I havent seen any of these. | Recommender: I've only seen Obsessed  (2009) but not the other two. But I hear they're good. | Recommender: There's also a new Idris Elba movie out called @The Mountain Between Us. Kate Winslet is in it. I hear it's pretty good. | User: Okay. I'll check it out. Is it on DVD like the others? | Recommender: No, that one is in theaters. But if you want something on DVD, try Hidden Figures (2016) . I LOVED it! It's about the black women who worked for NASA. | User: I heard about that! I think I will watch that. | User: Thanks for your help! | Recommender: You're welcome. Enjoy your movies!\nUser: Morning! I'm looking for some good films featuring black actors. | Recommender: Does time period matter? | User: Not at all. :) | Recommender: Great! Most of what I have are comedies. Def Jam's How to Be a Player (1997) is a good one. But if you want something a little more serious, try The Brothers  (2001) . Shemar Moore and Morris Chestnut are in that one. | User: Ok. I like Shemar. He was good on Criminal Minds. | Recommender: There's also The Wood (1999) featuring Taye Diggs and Omar Epps. It's similar to The Brothers  (2001) | User: Okay. Great | Recommender: Another good one is Talk to Me  (2007) . It's about Ralph &quot;Petey&quot; Greene, the radio talkshow host from the 60s. Don Cheadle is in that one. | User: I love Don Cheadle. Do you know any more movies by him? | Recommender: There are plenty, but I would recommend Brooklyn's Finest (2009) (with Welsey Snipes) and Traitor  (2008) . It's like an action/espionage film. | User: Okay, I'll give it a go. Thanks man. | Recommender: No problem. I hope you enjoy the movies!\nUser: Hello. | User: I'm looking for some films my wife and I can stream online and watch this morning. What do you recommend? | Recommender: Let's see. That all depends on what it is you're in the mood for. Any particular genre or time period? | User: No, not really. Just as long as it's a good mix of things. | Recommender: Okay then. First up I have Wild Things  (1998) with NEve Campbell. | Recommender: The girl from Scream  (1996) | Recommender: It's about  two high school girls who accuse a counselor of rape and seduce a cop. Pretty wild movie | User: :O | Recommender: lol | Recommender: I would also suggest District 9 (2009) . It's a sci-fi movie set in Johanesburg (sp) South Africa. An alien race arrives and they are treated rather cruelly. | User: So far so good. :) | Recommender: Another sci-fi film is Children of Men (2006) . It's less aliens and space craft and more a dystopian drama about the world after everyone has gone sterile. | Recommender: Clive Owen is in it. | Recommender: And for a bit of old school horror I'll suggest Demon Knight (1995) . It's an old Tales from the Crypt film | User: I loved that show! I hoped they'd do a remake, but never got around to it. :( | Recommender: It was pretty hilarious, lol. The Crypt Keeper was hilarious. | User: Thanks for your help! Have a good morning!\nUser: Hello. Can you recommend a good movie to see in theaters this weekend? | Recommender: Sure! | Recommender: As a matter of fact, I watched Murder on the Orient Express (2017) just last night with my son. We loved it. | Recommender: It's as good as the original. | User: That's the one about the mystery on a train in the mountains? | Recommender: Yes, it is. Johnny Depp and Daisy Ridley are in it. | Recommender: If you're into superheros Justice League  (2017) and Thor: Ragnarok (2017) are pretty good as well. | User: That's the third Thor movie, right? | User: I haven't seen the second one yet. | Recommender: Thor: The Dark World is okay, but Ragnarok is definitely better. | Recommender: If you decide to see the third film, make sure to see the second first so you'll understand what's going on. | User: Gotcha! | Recommender: Also, you might also be interested in Spider-Man: Homecoming (2017) . It's not in theaters anymore, but a good film nonetheless. | Recommender: But if you definitely want something\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content":
