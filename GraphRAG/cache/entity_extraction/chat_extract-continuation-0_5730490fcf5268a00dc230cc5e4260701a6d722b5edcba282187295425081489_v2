I love Ryan Reynolds. | Recommender: How about How to Lose a Guy in 10 Days (2003)? | User: I also really liked Patch Adams  (1998). | User: I don't think I've saw that one. | Recommender: That was a great movie. | User: Is it similar to What Women Want (2000) ? | Recommender: It's pretty funny. It has Kate Hudson and she has to have a guy dump her in 10 days for an article she needs to write. | User: Oh that does sound interesting. | Recommender: It is kind of similar in style, but stories are different. | Recommender: Notting Hill  is pretty funny too. | User: I think I'm going to look How to Lose a Guy in 10 Days (2003) up and see if I can rent it. | User: I love Notting Hill  | Recommender: It's so good! | Recommender: I hope you enjoy it! I have seen it way too many times, but still enjoy it everytime! | User: Awesome! Thank you so much! I hope you have a great evening! | Recommender: You too!

Something like Indiana Jones . I really like Harrison Ford. | Recommender: That's a great movie! Actually my favorite action film right now is Baby Driver  (2017) | User: I saw that. It was really good. It was unique. It had good music too. | Recommender: Definitely. If you like superhero movies, the Captain America: Civil War (2016) is good | Recommender: Troy  (2004) is older but I liked it as well as 300  (2007) | User: I'm not sure which one that is. Is it the second one? | User: Or the third? | Recommender: I think it's the 3rd! | Recommender: I can't really keep up, haha | User: Those are both good as well. | User: I haven't seen it then. I need to. I've been trying to catch up on all those super hero movies. | User: Is it better than the first two? Cause those are kind of boring. | Recommender: It wasn't as good as Iron Man  (2008) or Deadpool  (2016) in my opinion because it wasn't as funny, but still great action. | User: I'll give it a try. The new Thor: Ragnarok (2017) was definitely better than the two before those, so maybe I'll like Captain America: Civil War (2016) too. | User: Thank you for the suggestions! | Recommender: Oh yeah, that was great. sure thing, bye! | User: Bye!\nRecommender: Hello | User: Hello! | Recommender: What kind of movies are you looking for? | User: I am interested in some good action movies, new or old | User: My favorites are Die Hard (1988) and Kill Bill | Recommender: I was going to say Die Hard (1988) !
