Let me think.. | User: Okay. | Recommender: The Adventures of Sharkboy and Lavagirl in 3-D (2005) is a pretty silly one, definitely worth a watch if you haven't already seen it. | Recommender: Charlie and the Chocolate Factory  (2005) is also very goofy, quite charming even if it doesn't stand up to the original. | User: I haven't seen The Adventures of Sharkboy and Lavagirl in 3-D (2005) I love the name! I've seen Charlie and the Chocolate Factory  (2005), It wasn't my cup of tea. | Recommender: Have you seen Agent Cody Banks (2003) ? | Recommender: It's similar to spy kids in that it is about spies, but it's a little different. Still a silly and fun movie. | User: I haven't. Who is in it? | Recommender: It stars Frankie Muniz and Hilary Duff. A childhood favorite movie! | User: That sounds good! | Recommender: I'm sure you'll like it- I hope I was of some assistance! | User: You were, thanks. | User: Bye.\nRecommender: Hi, You're looking for movies? | User: Hey there, yeah I am. I'm looking for something like The Great Gatsby  (2013) | User: Classic or historical settings of the 1920s or as early as 1800 | Recommender: Have you seen Gone with the Wind  (1939)? | User: Yeah I liked that, that's a classic! | Recommender: What about Hidalgo  (2004)? | User: That sounds interesting, what's it about? I'll have to check it out. Never heard of it | Recommender: It's about horse racing in the wild west, maybe not very stylistically romantic, but very good. | Recommender: The Artist  (2011) is also quite good. | User: Yeah that sounds great. I love cowboy type movies | Recommender: The Artist  (2011) is set in the 20's. | User: The Artist  (2011) looks like exactly what I'm looking for! | Recommender: I'm glad! | User: Thanks a lot, I can't wait to watch that movie | Recommender: No problem. | Recommender: I hope you have a great night. | User: You too! Have a good night | User: Bye!\nRecommender: Hello! | Recommender: What kind of movies are you interested in? | User: hELLO | User: I am looking for a sports movie. | Recommender: Sure, are there any in specific you like? | User: I like The Mighty Ducks (1992) | Recommender: Have you seen Miracle  (2004) ? That's a great one. It's about a new coach joining the US Mens hockey team. | User: I haven't seen that one. I really like hockey so I am sure it will be good. | Recommender: Another great one is Slap Shot  (1977) , also a hockey movie. It is more of a drama, with some humorous bits. | User: Great I didn't know there was so many hockey movies. | Recommender: Yes there are quite a few! How about Goon  (2011) ? | Recommender: Goon  (2011) is a comedy about a bouncer-turned-hockey player. It's pretty funny. | User: I've heard of that. | Recommender: If you like hockey you'll love all these movies. I hope I was able to help! | User: Thank you, I think will have alot of new movies to check out. | User: Have a nice night. | Recommender: You too!\nRecommender: Hello! | Recommender: What kind of movies are you interested in? | User: Hi. I'm looking for some suggestions on coming of age movies like Stand by Me  (1986) | Recommender: Older or newer? | User: Either is fine. | Recommender: Off the top of my head, The Breakfast Club (1985) is a pretty popular one, that I think fits that similar description. A newer one would be The Perks of Being a Wallflower  starring Emma Watson. I really liked that one, it was pretty moving at times. | User: I have seen The Breakfast Club (1985) but I haven't seen The Perks of Being a Wallflower . I'll have to rent it. | Recommender: It's super good! I'm sure you'll love it. Another one is Juno (2007) , have you seen that one? | User: I haven't seen Juno (2007) That one has Ellen Page, right? | User: And Michael Cera? or am I thinking of soemthing else? | Recommender: Yep they are the main characters. It is a good drama with some great humor as well. | User: I'll check that out as well. | Recommender: I hope I was able to help! | User: Thank you for helping me. Have a nice night/day. Bye! | Recommender: Have a good one!\nRecommender: Hello! | Recommender: What kind of movies are you interested in? | User: I'm really interested in Disney movies, but i haven't seen many. | Recommender: Are there a few you've seen so I have a feel for what you are interested in? | User: I've seen Aladdin  (1992) and Beauty and the Beast  (1992\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}], "parameters": {"model": "gpt-3.5-turbo", "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "temperature": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0}}}
