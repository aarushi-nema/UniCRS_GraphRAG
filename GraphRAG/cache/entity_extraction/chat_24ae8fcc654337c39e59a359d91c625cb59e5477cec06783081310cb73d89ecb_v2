Kind of like Obsessed  (2009) starring Beyonce and Morris Chestnut, but instead this time, a woman is being stalked. | Recommender: Another good choice is No Good Deed  (2014) with Idris Elba. It's like the other two as well. | User: Oh okay. Wow. I havent seen any of these. | Recommender: I've only seen Obsessed  (2009) but not the other two. But I hear they're good. | Recommender: There's also a new Idris Elba movie out called @The Mountain Between Us. Kate Winslet is in it. I hear it's pretty good. | User: Okay. I'll check it out. Is it on DVD like the others? | Recommender: No, that one is in theaters. But if you want something on DVD, try Hidden Figures (2016) . I LOVED it! It's about the black women who worked for NASA. | User: I heard about that! I think I will watch that. | User: Thanks for your help! | Recommender: You're welcome. Enjoy your movies!\nUser: Hi! I'm in the mood for a good Tom Hanks movie this morning. Any ideas? | Recommender: Yeah, there are so many. How about recent? Inferno  (2016) was good, if you like his Dan Brown movies. | User: Dan Brown? | Recommender: Yeah, the author whose books have been adapted to film. Tom Hanks plays the lead character, Robert Langdon. | User: Oh okay. | User: Wait, didn't he write the Da vinci code? | Recommender: Yup! And they made a movie about it. Tom Hanks is in it. | User: I didn't know that. | Recommender: Yeah, The Da Vinci Code  (2006) came out in 2006 i think. | Recommender: Also, they did an adaptation of @Angels And Demons. | User: Oh okay. | Recommender: But all 3 movies are on DVD now so you'll have no problem finding them. | Recommender: My favorite Hanks film is A League of Their Own (1992) | User: I've seen that. It's a great film. | User: I also enjoyed Sleepless in Seattle (1993) and That Thing You Do! | Recommender: Same here! | User: :) | User: Well thanks for the sugestions. I'll probably just rent them from Amazon as downloads, and my partner and I will watch them after breakfast. | Recommender: sounds like a plan. Enjoy!\nUser: Morning! I'm looking for some good films featuring black actors. | Recommender: Does time period matter? | User: Not at all. :) | Recommender: Great! Most of what I have are comedies. Def Jam's How to Be a Player (1997) is a good one. But if you want something a little more serious, try The Brothers  (2001) . Shemar Moore and Morris Chestnut are in that one. | User: Ok. I like Shemar. He was good on Criminal Minds. | Recommender: There's also The Wood (1999) featuring Taye Diggs and Omar Epps. It's similar to The Brothers  (2001) | User: Okay. Great | Recommender: Another good one is Talk to Me  (2007) . It's about Ralph &quot;Petey&quot; Greene, the radio talkshow host from the 60s. Don Cheadle is in that one. | User: I love Don Cheadle. Do you know any more movies by him? | Recommender: There are plenty, but I would recommend Brooklyn's Finest (2009) (with Welsey Snipes) and Traitor  (2008) . It's like an action/espionage film. | User: Okay, I'll give it a go. Thanks man. | Recommender: No problem. I hope you enjoy the movies!\nUser: Hello. | User: I'm looking for some films my wife and I can stream online and watch this morning. What do you recommend? | Recommender: Let's see. That all depends on what it is you're in the mood for. Any particular genre or time period? | User: No, not really. Just as long as it's a good mix of things. | Recommender: Okay then. First up I have Wild Things  (1998) with NEve Campbell. | Recommender: The girl from Scream  (1996) | Recommender: It's about  two high school girls who accuse a counselor of rape and seduce a cop. Pretty wild movie | User: :O | Recommender: lol | Recommender: I would also suggest District 9 (2009) . It's a sci-fi movie set in Johanesburg (sp) South Africa. An alien race arrives and they are treated rather cruelly. | User: So far so good. :) | Recommender: Another sci-fi film is Children of Men (2006) . It's less aliens and space craft and more a dystopian drama about the world after everyone has gone sterile. | Recommender: Clive Owen is in it. | Recommender: And for a bit of old school horror I'll suggest Demon Knight (1995) . It's an old Tales from the Crypt film | User: I loved that show! I hoped they'd do a remake, but never got around to it. :( | Recommender: It was pretty hilarious, lol. The Crypt Keeper was hilarious. | User: Thanks for\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}], "parameters": {"model": "gpt-3.5-turbo", "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "temperature": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0}}}
