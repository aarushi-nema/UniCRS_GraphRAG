Brad Pitt was good in Fury  (2012) | Recommender: I'll have to check that one out. And yeah a little bit of a different direction, but still Sci-Fi Resident Evil: The Final Chapter (2016) was fantastic. Especially if you were a fan of the series. | User: Cool thank you. | Recommender: No problem!\nUser: Hi, how are you tonight? | User: can you help me find a good drama? | Recommender: Hello, I'm doing good, thanks! Yes of course. | Recommender: How do you like Fight Club (1999) ? Great movie and full of drama. | User: I saw that years ago, but didn't pay much attention. Maybe I should watch again | Recommender: Definitely worth a re-watch! | Recommender: How about something like Gran Torino (2008) ?

Thank you | User: yes, but I will definitely watch again | User: What is your favorite movie? | Recommender: Hmm well it's cliche but I'll have to go with The Godfather (1972) series. It's hard to pick one favorite. | User: oh wow, what a classic | User: All in the series? | Recommender: Of course I have to watch all of them at once when I do. | Recommender: You seem to have watched a lot of the classics so I'll think of something newer | User: hehe, ok | User: Thanks for your help | Recommender: Try out Red Sparrow (2018) it just came out in March. | User: I saw that at the theater! | User: it was truly good | Recommender: Oh really, I'm surprised. you must go out to watch movies a lot then haha.

This is a good one | Recommender: I can also recommend Shutter Island  (2010) | User: Yes! But did you fully understand this movie? I didn't | Recommender: I felt like I understood it, I remember explaining it to a friend after it ended. | User: I have watched it many times and still have questions | Recommender: If you like Leonardo DiCaprio Inception (2010) is also excellent, unsure if I can really understand that one tho. | User: Just like Inception (2010) | User: lol yes | User: What is your favorite movie? | Recommender: Definatly  The Thirteenth Floor (1999) which is also kind of a mystery. I really recommend it. | User: is that about the Hotel? | User: sounds familiar | Recommender: It's not that one.. I initially thought that when a friend told me about it.
