I also love the underrated Reign of Fire  (2002) | User: I love both of those! | User: I really like The Dark Crystal as well | Recommender: I haven't seen that in years. Always preferred The NeverEnding Story  (1984) | User: Falcore  | User: That was his name, right? | Recommender: yes! Always my favorite character as a kid | User: But yes, I loved those movies, even the sequels. | Recommender: I loved dragons. speaking of, Dragonheart (1996) is fun, if super cheesy.

I was nervous too | User: Thank you so much for recommending these cool movies | User: Have a wonderful day! | Recommender: Any time. Have a great day! :)\nUser: hello! | Recommender: Hey, so what type of movies do you like? | User: I was hoping you could recommend a few really good horror movies. | User: I love Insidious  (2011) | Recommender: Personally I enjoyed Mama  (2013), though it was more a thriller than a true horror. | User: I watched that movie but I wasnt a huge fan. | User: I like darker movies | Recommender: The new It  (2017) was pretty good, plus the original It (1990) wasn't too bad for a made for television thing | Recommender: House on the Hill  (2012) made me jump a few times | User: I really liked the original and I haven't had a chance to see the new one. | User: That was a really good movie!

What is the synopsis? | Recommender: It's a remake but they did it well.
