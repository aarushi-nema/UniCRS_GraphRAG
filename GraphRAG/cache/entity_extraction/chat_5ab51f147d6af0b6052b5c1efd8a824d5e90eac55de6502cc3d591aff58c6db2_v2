I haven't seen Seeking a Friend for the End of the World (2012)  though.Not sure I want to be depressed though! | Recommender: Haha, yeah. Pompeii  (2014) is another good one that's set in the past. | User: Oh I heard of that, and it did sound interesting | User: Thanks I think we have a winner! | Recommender: Great!
