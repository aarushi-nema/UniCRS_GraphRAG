Psycho  (1960) and The Birds  (1963) | User: ..are a few of my favorite old movies | Recommender: Those sound interesting | Recommender: I hope you enjoy the suggestions | Recommender: bye | User: Thanks! bye\nRecommender: Hi. Are you looking for some movies to watch this weekend? | Recommender: May I recommend a romantic comedy like When Harry Met Sally... (1989) ? | User: Can you recommend a good comedy that has Adam Sandler? | Recommender: Absolutely! Sandler is a genius. I just finished Happy Gilmore (1996) last night for the hundredth time | Recommender: I would recommend also Billy Madison (1995) , The Wedding Singer (1998) and The Longest Yard  (2005) | User: I have only seen Click  (2006) and 50 First Dates (2004) | Recommender: I've seen both of those, they are great. You have to check out Billy Madison (1995) first, especially if you were born before 1990. | User: Thanks, I will definitely look into that for my next date night | Recommender: Oh. Dont watch Billy Madison (1995) with a date! | Recommender: You should watch The Wedding Singer (1998) , its more date-worthy. | Recommender: Good luck! | User: Ok thanks, bye now\nRecommender: Hi there. | User: Hi, what movie would you recommend for a 7 year old boy? | Recommender: Hmm. Well, does he like animated films? I would suggest Toy Story (1995) if he does. Have you seen it? | Recommender: It's a fantastic and heartwarming story. | User: He does like animated and he has seen Toy Story 3 (2010), he also like action movies like Transformers  (2007) | Recommender: Ah, so I guess he's a little too modern for Honey, I Shrunk the Kids (1989) ? | Recommender: May I reccomend Antz (1998) ? He will surely love that | User: I dont think he would like Honey, I Shrunk the Kids (1989), but I will definitely have him watch Antz (1998) | Recommender: I would! I've seen it a dozen times and it seems to get better with time. | Recommender: Well, enjoy your movie, I hope he likes the choice! | User: Thank You, bye now\nUser: Hi, can you recommend a good comedy for a 13 year old girl? | Recommender: Hi! Sure. Could you tell me what she has seen before and if she liked or disliked it? | Recommender: It will help me recommend a good one. | User: She seems to love The Three Stooges  (2012) | Recommender: Really? That's interesting! I wouldn't expect a thirteen year old to be into slapstick. | Recommender: Have you tried screening an old one, The Three Stooges Go Around the World in a Daze (1963) ? | User: she finds it absolutely hilarious as her father does a perfect Curly impression, I actually have not heard of that one but I will definetly look into it | Recommender: If she's looking for a more contemporary style, maybe Anchorman  ? It's similar, but a little vulgar. | Recommender: But if she is a daddy's girl and she likes that style, she should check out Mrs. Doubtfire (1993) . | User: I have seen Mrs. Doubtfire (1993) and loved it so I will definetly have her watch that. Thanks so much for your help | Recommender: Anytime. Bye now! | User: bye now\nRecommender: Hello, what kind of movie are you looking to see? | Recommender: Are you looking for romance, comedy, or maybe a little of both? | User: I am looking for a romantic comedy similar to No Strings Attached  (2010) | Recommender: I've never seen it. But romantic comedies are pretty similar. Have you ever seen Say Anything... (1989) ? | User: No I actually have never heard of it. What about something similar to 50 First Dates (2004) | Recommender: I love that movie! | Recommender: Well, may I reccomend The Wedding Singer (1998) ? Same two actors! | User: I have seen and love that movie | Recommender: We have similar tastes, I still need to find you a movie. What about a more recent film? | Recommender: Like Grown Ups  (2010) ? It's not really romantic, but it will make up for it with laughs! | User: the last movie I actually watched was Mr. Deeds (2002) | Recommender: Did you like it? | User: i loved it | Recommender: Then you'll love Grown Ups  (2010) ! | Recommender: I hope that helps.
