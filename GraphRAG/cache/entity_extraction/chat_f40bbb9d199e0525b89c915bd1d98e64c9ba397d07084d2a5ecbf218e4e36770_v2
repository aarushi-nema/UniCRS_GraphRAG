Thanks so much for the Suicide Squad  (2016) suggestion. I may finally give it a shot | User: It was nice talking to you bud! Have a great superbowl weekend! | Recommender: You're welcome. The Joker in that movie was awesome. I hope you enjoy it.\nUser: hey there | Recommender: Hi there. Have you seen The Wonder  (2016) ? | User: Not yet. what genre is it | Recommender: I think it is a drama. I heard it was good. What kind of movies do you like? | User: I'll watch anything really. My favorites are comedies though. I love Anchorman 2: The Legend Continues (2013) | Recommender: That was funny. Do you like Adam Sandler? What about The Waterboy (1998) ? | User: If it's a drama I'll probably like The Wonder  (2016). Another one of my favorites Good Will Hunting (1997) is also a drama | Recommender: I also liked How to Lose a Guy in 10 Days (2003) | User: Yes I love the older Sandler flicks. He's lacking lately but Billy Madison (1995) and Big Daddy  (1999) are some of my favorites | Recommender: I loved Good Will Hunting (1997) ! Those were good. | Recommender: Another good comedy is The Big Sick (2017) | User: Ah, never seen How to Lose a Guy in 10 Days (2003). I may check that and The Wonder  (2016) out tonight | Recommender: I hope you do! | User: thanks so much for your suggestions | User: thanks so much for your suggestions | User: thanks so much for your suggestions | User: thanks so much for your suggestions | User: thanks so much for your suggestions | User: thanks so much for your suggestions | Recommender: Your welcome. Have a great weekend!\nUser: Hi! Got any good movie suggestions? I like dark comedies. | Recommender: That is a good category. I'm going to have to think for a second. | User: Cool. I also like absurd Mel Brooks-esque stuff | Recommender: I watched a good British comedy called Death at a Funeral  (2010) The British are good with that genre. | User: Ooo, I should check that out | Recommender: I just remembered another one. It's called In Bruges (2008) . It stars the actor that was the lead in Sunshine  (2007) | User: I haven't seen either one of those. What's In Bruges (2008) about? | Recommender: The plot involves two men that work as basically hired help for the mafia. They are really good friends but end up pitted against one another. They use dark humor to deal with the situation but it has a tragic ending. | User: Sounds good, I'm gonna write that one down | Recommender: One of my favorite movies is Seven Psychopaths (2012) . I liked it so much I've watched it probably 6 or 7 times. | User: Awesome. I have literally written both those down, ha | User: You ever see Withnail and I (1987) ? Classic. | Recommender: Cool. I hope you like them. I like dark comedies too and it is sometimes hard to find good movies of that sort. | Recommender: I haven't. I will check it out though. | User: Oh, you should, two out of work British actors, doing everything they can to get loaded... Another good one, little known, it was on Netflix... ahhh, yeah, God Bless America  (2011). Not great art, but fun. | Recommender: Thank You for Smoking (2005) is another one that sort of fits in this category. I will definitely check out the movie you mentioned. I love British acting and humor. | User: Yeah, I meant to watch Thank You for Smoking (2005) when it came out, I'll check that out, too. Thanks for the suggestions! | Recommender: Your welcome. Have a great weekend! | User: You, too! Cheers!\nUser: Hello. I hope you are having a good weekend. Have you seen any good movies you would recommend lately? | Recommender: Hello! Hope you are well, I would love to recommend Gold  (2016) | User: I haven't seen that. What genre would you consider it to be? | Recommender: Gold  (2016) would be considered a drama, has some suspense | User: Sounds good. I'll check it out. I think the last drama I watched was The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo  (2011) | Recommender: Another movie I recently watched was Moana  (2016) | User: That is a new one for me too. I'm getting a lot of good suggestions today. That's good since I want to expand my movie horizons, so to speak. | User: The last movie I saw in a cinema was The Shape of Water  (2017) . I'm normally interested in the Marvel franchises but everyone knows about them. It is nice to get some other suggestions. | Recommender: If you are into Superhero movies, I have become obsessed with Thor: Ragnarok (2017) recently too. The Shape of Water  (2017) I havent seen that yett | User: It's really good. It's a drama and I believe it is up for some awards but it also has a science fiction aspect. Really good movie overall. I watched Thor: Ragnarok (2017) too. Loved it. | User:\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}], "parameters": {"model": "gpt-3.5-turbo", "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "temperature": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0}}}
