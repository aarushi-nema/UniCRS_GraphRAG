Thinking | User: While that one is great, we saw it recently so I'd like to see something a little different. | Recommender: Ooh there's one on the tip of my tongue. Give me a minute | Recommender: It's a Mad, Mad, Mad World (1987) | User: Okay, no problem.  I'll mention one more that we like:  Smokey and the Bandit (1977) . | User: Oh, yeah!  It's a Mad, Mad, Mad World (1987) .  I remember I liked it, but I remember so little about it.  Just the name. | User: That sounds like a good one to see. | Recommender: What about The Sting (1973)  I love con men movies | User: Yes, that's a fun movie, too.

Great voice talent. Kate Blanchett, Naomi Harris, Benedict Cumberbatch | User: Cool. I am not a fan of live action movies though especially if it includes singing | User: Looking for a nice chickflick movie for tomorrow. Some friends are coming over and I want to show the sappiest movie I can find | Recommender: Terms of Endearment (1983) or Beaches  (1988) the original one.
