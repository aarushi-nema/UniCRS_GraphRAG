I'm not super picky! | Recommender: Ok well I would recommend the Saw  (2004)  series for someone who likes gory mixed with mystery. | User: That's a great movie, I enjoyed Saw 3D (2010) too | Recommender: I missed out on the 3d. I will have to check it out. | Recommender: For an excellent horror without the gore, you could check out The Conjuring (2013) . It has been one of my favorites in recent years. | User: I liked that movie, but I didn't exactly love it. | Recommender: And if you are interested by the boogey man, you can't go wrong with Halloween  (1978) , A Nightmare on Elm Street (1984) , and Friday the 13th  (1980) | User: I acutally haven't seen A Nightmare on Elm Street (1984) yet, but I love the other two! | User: Thanks for the great suggestions. | Recommender: Hope they were helpful.

They're classics! | Recommender: Yes they definitely are! If you want something more recent, a new you could check out the It  (2017) remake or even the Poltergeist  (2015)  remake. Both are pretty good. | Recommender: I do admit the original Poltergeist  (1982) is much better than the remake. | User: I happen to agree with you on that. I haven't seen the remake of It  (2017) though yet | Recommender: The new It  (2017) is much better than the original.
