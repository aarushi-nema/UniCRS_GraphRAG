Which older films? | User: Films like The Asphalt Jungle (1950)  and Murder, My Sweet | User: How was Elf  (2003) ? | Recommender: Those sounds like great movies. Are they mysteries? Have you watched Dr. Seuss' How the Grinch Stole Christmas  (2000) ? Yes, Elf was good!! | User: Yes they're mysteries. A little dark in the sense of tone, but not content. Very good if you're into that sort of thing. | User: And I've not see that version of the Dr. Seuss tale. With Jim Carrey right? | Recommender: Yes. It was also a good movie.

And various things go wrong. It is a comedy. | User: Sounds like it might be good. And with Tim Allen I'm sure the comedy is witty. :D | Recommender: He is a great actor.
