Children of the Corn  (1984) seems like a throwback to me. Weird kids in that one! | Recommender: Yes, Children of the Corn  (1984) is an oldie, but also remade in 2009 Children of the Corn  (2009) I think the 2009 one has the weird kids | User: I haven't seen the new one yet. | Recommender: Me either.  Just the trailers. | User: So did you like Jack Reacher  (2012)? | Recommender: Yes, I did like Jack Reacher  (2012) , I like the books as well though they've gotten very commercial | User: Too bad on the commercial aspect.
