It's about a new thing in the schools in Texas where if kids don't pass this exam, they &quot;die&quot; however they really don't, they just get sent underground. its to thin out the &quot;non-smart kids&quot; | User: That sounds pretty interesting! | Recommender: It was. Because the whole time I was thinking, &quot;what parent can let their kid die like that?&quot; and they actually don't die. lol | User: Right. lol they had to know something! That's what I thought about The Hunger Games  ! | Recommender: So i'm not sure if you're into gore type movies, but The Purge: Election Year (2016) is actually set in 2040 and The Purge: Anarchy (2014) is set in 2023 | Recommender: I enjoyed The Purge: Election Year (2016) more than the others. they are coming out with a new one this summer that is a prequel to all the Purge  (2012) movies | User: Just depends on the story line and such. I will check them out. | Recommender: And to throw in a light hearted movie WALL-E (2008) is a favorite of mine | User: That one is a classic! I watched it when it came out and fell in love with it! | Recommender: well i hope I have been a some help today! | User: You've been a lot of help! Thank you! | Recommender: Great! have a good day! | Recommender: goodbye!\nUser: Hello | Recommender: Hello! How are you today? | User: im good. I'm looking for romantic comedy movies. I'm trying to impress a girl with rom com knowledge so suggest as many as you may, please! | Recommender: Romcom! 50 First Dates (2004), Forgetting Sarah Marshall (2008), Sweet Home Alabama  (2002), and Breakfast at Tiffany's  (1961) are great! They're sure to win her over! | Recommender: If you're looking for something a bit more classic, Pretty Woman (1990) is a great place to start. | Recommender: Have you seen Pretty Woman (1990)? | User: oh wow those are all great suggestions! no. I havent seen any of them because i like action movies. | User: but the ladies like a softer guy | Recommender: Well, they do have some romcom action movies out there. Have you seen The Bounty Hunter  (2010)? | User: Oh that's a great one! I think we'll watch that one together. Thanks for the suggestions! | Recommender: You're very welcome! Best of luck! | User: Thanks! bye\nRecommender: Hi. What kind of movie are you looking for. | User: War movies please. I love Saving Private Ryan (1998) . IT was one of my favorites. | Recommender: Have you seen Hacksaw Ridge it was nominated last year. | Recommender: Also Dunkirk  (2017) is very good and nominated this year. | User: No, I did hear it was good so I think I would like that move. | User: A friend of mine saw Dunkirk  (2017)  and from her description it did not sound like the type of war movie I would like. | Recommender: Yes another classic is Jarhead  (2005). I have not seen it but everyone talks about it in my house. | User: That is a good on. Thanks! | Recommender: You are welcome. I would just be careful because like Dunkirk  (2017) I have been told if you have pts or don't like loud noises to be careful. | User: Thank you so much for the suggestions. Have a nice day. Bye now\nUser: Hi | Recommender: Hello | User: How are you? | User: I would like to watch an animated movie. Maybe something like Monsters, Inc. (2001) | Recommender: Oh! I love animated movies. Have you seen Toy Story (1995) , That is good, but equally as good in that series is Toy Story 3 (2010) | Recommender: I also loved watching Ice Age  (2002) | Recommender: Or Shrek (2001) . Any of those movies are good and funny. | User: Honestly I'm not a big fan of Toy Story (1995) . I mean it's a good movie but for some reason i just don't like it | User: Ice Age  (2002) and Shrek (2001) are such funny movies! | User: I also like movies like Up  (2009) and Inside Out  (2015) . They are so cute and have a really good message | Recommender: Those were really good movies. Have you seen Coco  (2017) ? THat's a new movie you might like. | User: No! I haven't yet. I've heard about it but never got a chance to watch it | User: I would really like to watch it | Recommender: That would be my suggestion of a new movie to watch. I hope you like it. | User: Thank you for great suggestions | User: Have a good day | Recommender: Bye\nRecommender: hello | Recommender: How are you today | Recommender: can I help you find a movie you might like? | User: i am looking for an action\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>THE HUNGER GAMES: MOCKINGJAY – PART 1 (2014)<|>MOVIE<|>A 2014 action movie)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>THE THINNING<|>MOVIE<|>A YouTube movie about a new system in schools in Texas)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>THE PURGE: ELECTION YEAR (2016)<|>MOVIE<|>A 2016 action movie set in 2040)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>THE PURGE: ANARCHY (2014)<|>MOVIE<|>A 2014 action movie set in 2023)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>THE PURGE (2012)<|>MOVIE<|>A movie series including The Purge: Election Year)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>WALL-E (2008)<|>MOVIE<|>A 2008 animated movie)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ROMANTIC COMEDY<|>GENRE<|>Genre of movies involving romance and comedy)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>50 FIRST DATES (2004)<|>MOVIE<|>A 2004 romantic comedy movie)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>FORGETTING SARAH MARSHALL (2008)<|>MOVIE<|>A 2008 romantic comedy movie)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SWEET HOME ALABAMA (2002)<|>MOVIE<|>A 2002 romantic comedy movie)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>BREAKFAST AT TIFFANY'S (1961)<|>MOVIE<|>A 1961 romantic comedy movie)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>PRETTY WOMAN (1990)<|>MOVIE<|>A 1990 romantic comedy movie)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>THE BOUNTY HUNTER (2010)<|>MOVIE<|>A 2010 romantic comedy action movie)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>WAR<|>GENRE<|>Genre of movies involving war and conflict)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SAVING PRIVATE RYAN (1998)<|>MOVIE<|>A 1998 war movie)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>HACKSAW RIDGE<|>MOVIE<|>A movie nominated for awards)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>DUNKIRK (2017)<|>MOVIE<|>A 2017 war movie)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>JARHEAD (2005)<|>MOVIE<|>A 2005 war movie)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ANIMATED<|>GENRE<|>Genre of movies involving animation)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>MONSTERS, INC.
