I just saw it this past weekend | Recommender: if your more interested in newer fantasy there's also lots of YA series like Ender's Game  (2013) | User: Great that sounds interesting. | Recommender: not my favorite, but a classic still the same | User: I really like fantasy | User: Thank you | User: Bye | Recommender: hope you find something\nRecommender: Hi! What can I recommend for you today? | User: I like comedies like Dumb and Dumber (1994) | Recommender: Ok. How about Anchorman 2: The Legend Continues (2013) or Superbad  (2007) | Recommender: Of course, the The Hangover (2009)  is a classic | User: What do you like about them? | Recommender: They were funny is a silly kind of way I guess. | User: How often to you rewatch them? | Recommender: There is also Deadpool  (2016) | User: Yea I think i will watch that | Recommender: I didn't think I would like that when I saw the trailer but I ended up really liking it | Recommender: I have not watched those older movies in a long time. | User: Thanks for the suggestions | User: Goodbye | Recommender: You are welcome! Have a fantastic day\nUser: Hello! This is my first time in Movie Chat! | Recommender: Im actually new as well | Recommender: what kind of movies are you interested in? | User: What is your favorite movie of all time? Mine is Star Wars  (1977) | User: I love Science Fiction movies. | Recommender: Thus us a hard question for me, but I think Terminator 2: Judgment Day (1991) is my top. | Recommender: I love scifi too | Recommender: which Star Wars  (1977)  is your favorite? | User: That's a really good one. Sarah Connor is such an amazing character. I just re-watched Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines (2003) a couple of days ago. It feels so hollow without her in it. Arnold is the star, but Linda Hamilton is really what made The Terminator (1984) and Terminator 2: Judgment Day (1991) such compelling films. | Recommender: She honestly is in incredible through the whole thing | User: The original Star Wars  (1977) is my favorite by far, but The Empire Strikes Back (1980) and Return of the Jedi (1983) are wonderful too. | User: I don't particularly like the prequel trilogy, Star Wars: Episode I – The Phantom Menace (1999)  and Star Wars: The Clone Wars  (2008) are especially bad. | Recommender: what are your thpughts on Star Wars: The Force Awakens (2015) | Recommender: or Star Wars: Episode VIII – The Last Jedi (2017) | User: It's OK, it's growing on me, but the new trilogy lacks some of the gravitas of the first trilogy. | Recommender: the prequels are slightly less painful if you watch in machete order I think | User: Now the stand alone Star Wars movies look very promising. Rogue One: A Star Wars Story (2016) was excellent, and I have high hopes for the upcoming Han Solo movie. | User: Sorry, machete order? | Recommender: so you do Star Wars  (1977) then The Empire Strikes Back (1980) , Star Wars: The Clone Wars  (2008) Star Wars: Episode III – Revenge of the Sith (2005) and end with Return of the Jedi (1983) | Recommender: it shifts the perspective in some fun ways | User: Interesting, I may have to do that. I have al of the Star Wars films on iTunes. | Recommender: because 2 and three then become flashbacks in the original arc rather than their own messy stand alone thing | User: Oh! Clever! | Recommender: its also just a fun way to kill a weekend if you don't have other plans | User: Hmmm I wonder how Rogue One: A Star Wars Story (2016) would work as a flashback... after Star Wars  (1977) the original? | Recommender: I'm not sure if they have worked in the new films yet but theres lots of discussion if you just google Star Wars  (1977)  and machete order | User: I will do that. Thank you so much for the recommendation! | User: I think we have mentioned enough movies now, thanks for the chat! | Recommender: thanks bye\nRecommender: Hi! What kind of movies do you like? | User: Hello. i am looking for something to really make me laugh. | User: I like movies like The Hangover (2009) | Recommender: Awesome! I like that movie a lot! Have you seen The 40-Year-Old Virgin (2005) ? | Recommender: Bridesmaids  (2011) is a favorite\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>A
