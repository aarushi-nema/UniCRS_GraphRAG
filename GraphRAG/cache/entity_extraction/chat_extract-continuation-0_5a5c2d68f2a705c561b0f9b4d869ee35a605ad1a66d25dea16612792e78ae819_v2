I think Star Wars  (1977) might be a good suggestion if you like those. It may seem like an odd comparison but they both are fun high energy franchises with big fan bases. (and lots of films.) lol | User: I keep saying that I'm going to give Star Wars a try, just haven't got around to it yet. | Recommender: Also another car film I saw and kind of liked was Torque  (2004). It's not much talked about, but I quite enjoyed it | User: Car movies are definitely a favorite of mine, i think I was a racer in a past life or something. | Recommender: lmao. I'd also suggest Talladega Nights: The Ballad of Ricky Bobby (2006) if you haven't seen! Super funny! | Recommender: Hope you like my suggestions pal!
