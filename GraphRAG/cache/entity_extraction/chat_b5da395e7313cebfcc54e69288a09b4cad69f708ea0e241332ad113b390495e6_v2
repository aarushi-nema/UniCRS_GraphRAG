Was it good? | User: I saw previews but not the movie. | Recommender: I enjoyed it. It is kid friendly, but still had some points that made me giggle. | User: Okay! I'll have to give it a try. I bet my kids will like it too. | Recommender: The new Jumanji  (2017) is pretty awesome too. | User: That one was good.
