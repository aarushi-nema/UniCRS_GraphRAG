I haven't gotten around to seeing that one. | Recommender: Cool! You got some watching to do! Thanks for letting me suggest some movies! | Recommender: Bye! | User: Thanks for the suggestions! | User: Bye!\nRecommender: Hi there. | User: Hello. | Recommender: What kind of movies do you like? | User: I'm hoping to find some science fiction movies if you are familiar with the genre. | User: If not I also like horror and drama. | Recommender: Sure!  Have you seen The Matrix (1999)? | User: Yes. I loved it. I've watched the entire trilogy repeatedly. It's a staple | Recommender: Inception (2010) and Looper  (2012) are both good. | Recommender: If you like the sweeter side of sci-fi, there is About Time  (2013).  It's time travel, so I think that counts as sci-fi. | User: Yes I did enjoy Looper  (2012) . That was a movie that really stayed with me. I will be watching Inception (2010) . | User: I've heard of that. I think I'll check it out as well. | Recommender: Okay, I hope one of those works out for you! | User: I'll check out both of the new ones. Thank you so much! | User: Have a good night. | Recommender: You too!\nRecommender: Hello. How are you tonight? | User: Fine, thanks.  And you? | Recommender: I'm doing well. What sort of movies do you normally prefer? | User: I like romantic comedies.  I like a lot of the older ones like You've Got Mail (1998), or newer ones like Home Again (2017) (love Reese Witherspoon!) | Recommender: Those are both good movies. Have you ever seen Notting Hill   or Love Actually (2003) | User: Yes, I have seen both.  Notting Hill  is one of my favorites!  Love Actually (2003) was pretty good, too. | Recommender: I thought The Lake House  (2006)  was a very good romance. Have you seen it? | User: Yes, that is another really good one! | Recommender: Juno (2007)  is a romance, in a way, although there is a rather serious theme to the movie. | User: Serious themes are fine.  That one sounds good, maybe I will watch that! | User: Thank you for the suggestions! | Recommender: You're welcome. I hope you enjoy the movie. | User: Thanks!  Good night!\nUser: Hi, I'm looking for a good movie | User: I really like action movies like Die Hard (1988) | User: And Commando  (1985) | User: Do you have any suggestions like these? | Recommender: I would definitely recommend the  movie True Lies (1994) | User: That sounds interesting | User: Is it like Predator  (1987) ? | Recommender: It has the same lead actor but it does have more comedy elements. | User: Oh that sounds interesting | User: I think I'll check it out | User: Thank you so much for your help | User: have a great day | Recommender: You are very welcome!\nRecommender: Hello, what kind of movies are you looking to watch | User: I am looking for a movie, any thoughts.

Have you seen it | Recommender: I havent actually but Ive hear good things about it | User: What about It  (2017)  the remake with the clown | Recommender: if you like terror movies then you will like Annabelle  (2014)  and Annabelle 2 (2017) | User: I heard that It  (2017) was disturbing and these type of movies are why a lot of people do not like clowns | Recommender: I liked the old version of the movie so im guessing the newer one must be great as well. | User: Another one I was thinking about was Ted  (2012) | User: Ted  (2012)  has the bear that comes &quot;alive&quot; . I heard it was funny | Recommender: It is pretty funny, ive seen that one and I liked it a lot | Recommender: its a blast | User: Who is the main star of Ted  (2012) | User: I cannot think of his name | Recommender: Marc Wahlberg is the name of the main actor | User: I think he and his brother own a restaurant in Boston. I heard he was really good in the Ted  (2012)  movie. I think I will rent it. Good speaking with you | Recommender: Yeah you will probably enjoy it | Recommender: hope you like the movie and have a nice weekend, bye.\nUser: Hello, im looking for a movie similar to Rush Hour 3 (2007) | User: or maybe something like Deadpool  (2016) | User: I love action movies with comedy in theml | User: could you please suggest some interesting tittles? | Recommender: What about 48 Hours (1982)? | User: I havent seen that one, is it good? | Recommender: Yes.
