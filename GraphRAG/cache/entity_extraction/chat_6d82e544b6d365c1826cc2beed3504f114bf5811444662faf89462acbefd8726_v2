That one was pretty good. | Recommender: Made of Honor (2008) Was also a good funny romance movie | User: I haven't seen that one. Who is in it? | Recommender: and if My Big Fat Greek Wedding (2002) counts it's super hilarious | User: Ha! That one is the best. I love the dad. | Recommender: Made of Honor (2008) as Patrick Dempsey and Michelle Monaghan. | User: I need to see that one. I love Patrick Dempsey. I think I saw preview for it years ago. | User: Thank you for the suggestion! I hope you have a good night. | Recommender: You too. Bye!\nUser: Hello! | Recommender: Hey can I help you find some movies? | User: Yes! I'm would like to watch a good western. I really enjoyed 3:10 to Yuma  (2007). | Recommender: I really enjoyed True Grit  (2010) | User: I haven't seen that one. How does it compare to the original? | Recommender: The Dark Valley (2014)  was also good. | Recommender: I don't think True Grit  (2010) is as good as the original, but it is more updated. | User: John Wayne is a favorite of mine. I haven't seen that other one. What is it about? | Recommender: It's actually kind of dark, this cowboy arrives in the alps in this little town and some weird things go down. There is at least one shoot out though. | Recommender: And High Noon (1952) is a classic. | User: I'll have to try that one out. Sounds interesting. | User: Yes! I love that one! | Recommender: I feel like High Noon (1952) is a movie everyone should see at least once. | Recommender: I also really like Dances with Wolves (1990) | User: I agree. Even my grandpa in Japan loved that movie. | User: Yes! Kevin Costner in that movie is pretty good. | Recommender: Thats awesome! | User: Well, thank you for the suggestions and reminding me of those other great movies. Have a good night. | Recommender: Good night!\nRecommender: Good evening! | User: Hello! Can you help me find some movies with dogs in them? | Recommender: Yes! I have always loved dog movies. | Recommender: Have you seen Hachi: A Dog's Tale (2009) with Richard Gere? | User: I haven't. Is it sad or happy? | Recommender: Well, kind of both. Kind of sad. It is about a dog who waits at the same train station for his owner everyday, but the owner gets sick. | Recommender: Sorry, kind of a spoiler... but it is a sweet story. It based on a true story. | Recommender: There is a train station in Japan and they have a statue of this dog. | User: That sounds really interesting actually. | Recommender: It's beautiful. It's kind of a popular meeting place. | User: Do you know any more dog movies like that? | Recommender: Another dog movie that I really loved when I was younger is Homeward Bound: The Incredible Journey (1993). | Recommender: Have you seen that one? | User: I have seen that one, It's really nostalgic for me. | Recommender: Me too. I don't usually love when animals talk, but I really liked this one. | Recommender: What is your favorite dog movie? | User: Maybe not a true dog movie but i'm fond of Toto from The Wizard of Oz  (1939) | Recommender: Oh gosh. He is cute. | Recommender: I also liked Eight Below (2006). It has huskies in it and I grew up with huskies. | Recommender: They are beautiful dogs and the story was pretty good and exciting. | User: I haven't seen that. I love huskies, so that seems like a good choice. | Recommender: It was good. I just watched it with my kids and they loved it. Now they want a dog, but my son is sadly very allergic. | Recommender: I hope you get a chance to watch those! | User: I'm putting them on my list, thank you very much. | User: Have a good night! | Recommender: You are welcome. | Recommender: Bye!\nUser: Hello! | Recommender: Hello, what kind of movies are you interested in? | User: I like dramas and action movies. | Recommender: Have you seen Dunkirk  (2017)? I really enjoyed that one. | User: I did. It was really good. Kind of stressful to watch, but I enjoyed it. | Recommender: What about the new Tomb Raider (2018) movie? much less stressful. | User: No! I didn't even realize they had remade it. Is it good? | Recommender: It's really good. Still in theaters too. | User: I'll have to watch it. | Recommender: I also really enjoyed Black Panther (2018) as well. | User: I need to see that one too. I just watched Doctor Strange  (2016). The newer Marvel movies are pretty good. | User: I heard that Black Panther (2018) was a little darker, did you think so? | Recommender: I feel like they are getting better and better. Also if you like funny action Deadpool  (2016) was great | Recommender: Yes | User: Saw that one\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}], "parameters": {"model": "gpt-3.5-turbo", "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "temperature": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0}}}
