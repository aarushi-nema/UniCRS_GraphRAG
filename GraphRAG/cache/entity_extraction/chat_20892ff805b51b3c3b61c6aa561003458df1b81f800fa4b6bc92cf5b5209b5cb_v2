Oh okay. Thanks. Guess it's going to be an Underworldly kind of night. Take care\nUser: Hey!  I am looking for a good movie. | Recommender: Okay. What genre are you a fan of? | User: I like horror movies similar to The Blair Bitch Project (1999) | Recommender: okay. Have you seen Blair Witch  (2016) ? The remake? | Recommender: Or continuation rather | User: I did not.  Is it silly like the sequel Book of Shadows: Blair Witch 2 (2000) ? | Recommender: It's more of a serious tone like the first film | Recommender: Also, have you seen @The Witch (2015) | User: I did.  It was very good!  Much better than The Conjuring (2013) ! | Recommender: WHAAAT!?! You didn't like The Conjuring (2013) I loved it. :) | User: Heh, I guess it wasn't that bad!  Insidious  (2011) was worse!  :P | Recommender: Definitely Agree! | User: I like goofy horror movies when they are meant to be goofy.  Like The Texas Chainsaw Massacre 2 (1986) | User: But bad horror movies are just bad. | Recommender: I agree. You want to be terrified a bit, not looking at the screen thinking WTF??\nUser: Hi can you recommend a good movie | Recommender: Sure. What genre? | User: Horror. Something with witches and demons | Recommender: Oh that's easy. Have you seen Blair Witch  (2016) ? | User: No. But I've seen The Blair Witch Project (1999) are they similar? | Recommender: They are. But the newer film is more of a continuation than a remake. | Recommender: And it's not silly like Book of Shadows: Blair Witch 2 (2000) | User: Oh okay. I was wondering about that. Good to hear that. I hate stupid horror. | User: Like Child's Play 2 (1990) . The first was good, then the rest got all silly and stupid | Recommender: But it's different when it's meant to be funny. Like A Nightmare on Elm Street (1984) | User: True. The humor made sense along with the gore. | User: Thanks for your suggestions. You've been a big help today. :)\nRecommender: Hey!  Have you seen Wonder Woman  (2017) yet?  It is really good. | User: No I have not, who is it starring? | User: I like horror movies. | User: Hello? | Recommender: I like those too! | Recommender: Particularly gory ones like The Texas Chain Saw Massacre (1974) | User: Do you have any suggestions for horror films? | Recommender: Have you seen it? | User: I have never seen the original, only the ones from 2003 and 2006 | User: I like all Amityville horror movies. | Recommender: (And Wonder Woman  (2017) stars Gal Gadot). | User: Okay I will watch it today, my mom's favorite comic character is Wonder Woman. | Recommender: Those are good!  I'd recommend Lake Mungo  (2008) as it is similar to the amityville type movies. | User: I have heard of it but never gave it a chance! I am writing down all of the names now. | Recommender: You might also like It  (2017) !  It's better than the original! | User: Thank you for your suggestions. | Recommender: Anytime! | User: I have never seen the original, but I watched the first twenty minutes and it was a bit slow. | User: Maybe I will re-watch it and fast forward it a bit. Thank you for your time it was great chatting with you about movies. | Recommender: Have a good day! | User: You as well!\nUser: Hi. I'm looking for some good movie recommendations | Recommender: okay. what genre? | User: I like werewolves and vampires | Recommender: What kind? Twilight  (2008) variety? | Recommender: Or more Underworld  (2003) ? | User: No Twilight  (2008) lol | Recommender: Well the Underworld franchise is what you want. My favorite is Underworld: Evolution (2006) . It explains more of the backstory | User: Oh okay. is it gory or more comedy? | Recommender: definitely gory. Also, you might want to check out The Wolfman  (2010) with Anthony Hopkins\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}], "parameters": {"model": "gpt-3.5-turbo", "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "temperature": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0}}}
