I think it just came out on dvd yesterday | User: I've seen National Treasure  (2004), but not Jumanji  (2017), I heard mixed reviews about it | Recommender: Same here. But it was definitely funnier than expected | User: Now that's it out on DVD it might be worth getting at Redbox | User: It's got a pretty great cast | Recommender: I think amazon prime video has it as well | Recommender: It really does! | User: Oh, that's even better! | Recommender: Anything with Kevin Hart is hilarious! | User: Very true | Recommender: Ever seen Why Him%3F (2016) ? | Recommender: That's another great movie | User: I remember previews for it, but I haven't seen it | Recommender: Definitely check it out.
