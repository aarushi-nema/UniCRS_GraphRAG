It's a 3 part story about the British evacuation from France during WWII | User: hmm | User: that is a interesting one | Recommender: It's not quite linear. You follow 3 different aspects of the evacuation (land, air, sea) as they intersect during the conflict. | User: what is the name of that movie | Recommender: Dunkirk  (2017) | Recommender: But there seem to be a few of them in this system, so I mean the one by Christopher Nolan. | User: oh i think i want to see that movie | Recommender: Yes I recommend it. (Also, I did not see Slumdog Millionaire (2008). I might eventually, but it's not really my thing) | User: okay then what do you think bahubali movie? | Recommender: I don't understand | User: bagubali is the name of a movie that is not listed here | Recommender: Oh I don't know that one.

It's another British-American Film. | User: I've seen Dunkirk. I enjoyed it well enough. | Recommender: Yes it was definitely a great movie. | Recommender: If you are interested into books turned into movies, Murder on the Orient Express (2017) is like a mystery-drama. | Recommender: Definitely not a Chick Flik | User: I've seen that one, too. I liked it a lot and nope, no chick flick. | Recommender: If you liked that one, you should also check out Silence  (2016) | User: I've never seen that. Have you? Did you like it? | Recommender: It was directed by Martin Scorsese who is a phenomenal director. | Recommender: One great thing about it.
