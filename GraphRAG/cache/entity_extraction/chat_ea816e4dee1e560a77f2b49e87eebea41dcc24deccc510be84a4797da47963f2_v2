I am looking for a good Disney movie, if you have any suggestions | Recommender: Have you seen Jumpin' Jack Flash  (1986). It isn't a Disney movie, but it has Whoopi Goldberg. | Recommender: I know that Monsters, Inc. (2001) was a good one. | User: I have not but I do like Whoopi Goldberg so I should check it out. I love Sister Act (1992) | User: Monsters, Inc is definitely one of my favorite movies | Recommender: I heard that The Nut Job (2014) and The Nut Job 2 (2017) were funny as well. | User: I haven't seen either of those either.
