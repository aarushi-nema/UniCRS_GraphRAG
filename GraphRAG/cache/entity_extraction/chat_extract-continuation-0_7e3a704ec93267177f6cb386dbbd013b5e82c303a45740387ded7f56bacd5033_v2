It was so funny! | User: I've seen both of them. I really liked them! | Recommender: Also, Diary of a Wimpy Kid: The Long Haul  came out last summer I believe, that was a really fun one. | User: I haven't seen that one.

I love The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance (1962) with John Wayne and Jimmy Stewart. | Recommender: My personal favorite is High Noon (1952) , that is one that never gets old for me. A good John Wayne one that I love is The Searchers  (1956) ! | User: I haven't seen High Noon (1952) who is in that one? | User: The other one is really good. | Recommender: It stars Gary Cooper and Grace Kelly. A classic! | Recommender: A good newer one is Tombstone  (1993) | User: Wow! I will have to watch that one. | User: I haven't seen that one either.
