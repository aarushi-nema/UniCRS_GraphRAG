You got some watching to do! Thanks for letting me suggest some movies! | Recommender: Bye! | User: Thanks for the suggestions! | User: Bye!\nRecommender: Hi there. | User: Hello. | Recommender: What kind of movies do you like? | User: I'm hoping to find some science fiction movies if you are familiar with the genre. | User: If not I also like horror and drama. | Recommender: Sure!  Have you seen The Matrix (1999)? | User: Yes. I loved it. I've watched the entire trilogy repeatedly. It's a staple | Recommender: Inception (2010) and Looper  (2012) are both good. | Recommender: If you like the sweeter side of sci-fi, there is About Time  (2013).  It's time travel, so I think that counts as sci-fi. | User: Yes I did enjoy Looper  (2012) . That was a movie that really stayed with me. I will be watching Inception (2010) . | User: I've heard of that. I think I'll check it out as well. | Recommender: Okay, I hope one of those works out for you! | User: I'll check out both of the new ones. Thank you so much! | User: Have a good night. | Recommender: You too!\nUser: Good evening. | Recommender: Hello. I hope your doing well tonight. | User: I am, thanks.  I hope you are as well. | Recommender: Is there anything you are looking for in particular? | User: I'm hoping you can recommend a good animated movie.  I like Disney movies like Brave  (2012), and also anime movies like Kiki's Delivery Service (1989) and Spirited Away. | Recommender: The anime I will have to think about for a minute. The only movie in anime I can think of is the DragonBallZ movie that I can't remember the title of. I'll think of it in a minute. As for animated, have you ever seen Madagascar  (2005) | User: I have seen Madagascar  (2005), yes!  Liked it.  It's been quite a while though, so I wouldn't mind watching that one again. | Recommender: I have an anime one now. Have you seen Grave of the Fireflies (1988) ? | Recommender: I really liked Penguins of Madagascar (2014) as well. The movies make me sad in a way due to the situation of Madagascar in reality. | User: Ah, another Studio Ghibli film!  I actually have not seen that one, so thanks for the suggestion! | User: I haven't seen Penguins of Madagascar (2014), so thanks for that suggestion as well! | Recommender: You're welcome. I'm not very informed on anime as I just watch when one catches my interest. I hope you enjoy that one. | User: I'm sure I will.  Thank you for the suggestions! | User: I hope the rest of your night is great.\nRecommender: Hello. How are you tonight? | User: Fine, thanks.  And you? | Recommender: I'm doing well. What sort of movies do you normally prefer? | User: I like romantic comedies.  I like a lot of the older ones like You've Got Mail (1998), or newer ones like Home Again (2017) (love Reese Witherspoon!) | Recommender: Those are both good movies. Have you ever seen Notting Hill   or Love Actually (2003) | User: Yes, I have seen both.  Notting Hill  is one of my favorites!  Love Actually (2003) was pretty good, too. | Recommender: I thought The Lake House  (2006)  was a very good romance. Have you seen it? | User: Yes, that is another really good one! | Recommender: Juno (2007)  is a romance, in a way, although there is a rather serious theme to the movie. | User: Serious themes are fine.  That one sounds good, maybe I will watch that! | User: Thank you for the suggestions! | Recommender: You're welcome. I hope you enjoy the movie. | User: Thanks!  Good night!\nUser: Hi, I'm looking for a good movie | User: I really like action movies like Die Hard (1988) | User: And Commando  (1985) | User: Do you have any suggestions like these? | Recommender: I would definitely recommend the  movie True Lies (1994) | User: That sounds interesting | User: Is it like Predator  (1987) ? | Recommender: It has the same lead actor but it does have more comedy elements. | User: Oh that sounds interesting | User: I think I'll check it out | User: Thank you so much for your help | User: have a great day | Recommender: You are very welcome!\nRecommender: Hello, what kind of movies are you looking to watch | User: I am looking for a movie, any thoughts.
