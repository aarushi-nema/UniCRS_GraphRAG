Soapdish (1991) is great though. Probably more up your alley. | Recommender: You might also like Romancing the Stone (1984) or The Jewel of the Nile (1985) | User: Ahh okay, I probably wouldn't see the first one but Soapdish (1991) sounds good! | User: Haven't heard of either of those, but I will have to check them out! | User: Thanks for the suggestions! | User: bye!\nUser: Hello. | Recommender: Hello!

I'd love to see it. | Recommender: I prefer the television version still, but mainly because I love Tim Curry. | User: I love The Shining  (1980) | Recommender: Of course, if you want a 'scary movie' that is good for a laugh, try Dracula 3000 (2004) .
