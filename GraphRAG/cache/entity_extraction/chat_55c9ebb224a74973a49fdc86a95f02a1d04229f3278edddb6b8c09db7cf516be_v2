Do you know of any good drama movies? I love Changeling  (2008) with Angelina Jolie and I also love Million Dollar Baby (2004) with Hilary Swank. | User: In general I just really love good drama movies with great storylines. | Recommender: I love hilary swank! Have you seen The Black Dahlia  (2006) ? | User: Yes!!! That one is such an under rated movie but it is so good! | User: I love movies like that! | Recommender: She's also in The Homesman (2014) | Recommender: It's simialr to Cold Mountain  (2003) but a little grittier | User: Have you seen the movie with Hilary Swank called You're Not You (2014) ? | User: I love Cold Mountain  (2003) with Nicole Kidman!! | User: I've never heard of that movie The Homesman (2014) but I will definitely look into that movie. | Recommender: Another good one is Red Dust  (2004). | User: What is that movie about? | Recommender: It's about a post apartheid South Africa and the tensions in politics. Reminds me of The Pelican Brief  (1993) in terms of tone and feel | User: I haven't seen that movie either haha. | User: But so far we have had similar tastes so I am for sure going to check those out because they sound really good. | Recommender: Awesome. Glad I could help. :) | User: Merry Christmas! Thanks again for everything. Hope you have a great day, goodbye.\nRecommender: Hello | User: hi there! | Recommender: What can I suggest for you as a movie to watch. | User: what sorts of movies are you into? | User: Whoops! | User: I'm looking for a good classic Christmas film | Recommender: Okay let me think | Recommender: How about Bad Santa (2003) | Recommender: Home Alone (1990) | User: I've never seen Bad Santa (2003) . Is it anything like Office Christmas Party (2016) ? | Recommender: National Lampoon's Christmas Vacation (1989) | Recommender: Its got Billy Bob Thornton in it and not similar at all. | User: Oh okay. | User: Is Billy Bob the bad santa? lol | Recommender: Theres also Die Hard (1988) a great Christmas Action | Recommender: Yes Billy Bob is a drunk santa | Recommender: Or Jingle All the Way (1996). | User: lol I might like that one then. | Recommender: I hope I helped and nice chatting with you. | User: And I've seen Jingle All the Way (1996) . It's my son and I's favorite christmas movie to watch together | Recommender: Great movie. Merry Christmas to you.\nUser: Hi how are you? | User: I am looking for some good drama/thriller movies. | Recommender: im good yourself? | User: I love movies like Double Jeopardy  (1999) | Recommender: Okay let me see....... have you seen The Resident (2011) with Hilary Swank? | Recommender: Also Nocturnal Animals  (2016) is also a good one. | User: Kiss the Girls  (1997) is another one my favorites. Is that the movie when the guy from greys anatomy is a stalker and looks in her room? | User: Because that is a great movie! | User: I watched Nocturnal Animals  (2016) but it was a little confusing for me. | Recommender: really? I thought it was pretty good. | Recommender: what about The Accountant  (2016) with Ben Affleck? | User: That was a good movie! It was really good | Recommender: And while I'm thinking about it, Split (2017) with James McAvoy is an intense film. Not as intense as say, Seven  (1995) , but it's still good. | User: The Life of David Gale (2003) is another murder mystery movie that I love because it's sort of similar to Seven  (1995) which I love. | User: I have seen Split (2017) which was good. | Recommender: I've never seen The Life of David Gale (2003) . Who's in it? | User: Kevin Spacey is starring in it with Kate Winslet, it is about a man who is accused of murder, but he was an activist against the death penalty, but it's ironic because now he is on death row for a murder he claims he did not commit. | Recommender: Oh okay. Sounds almost like Just Cause  (1995) with Sean Connery. | User: Never seen that one, but I will check that one out! | User: Thank you for the suggestions! | User: Have a nice day. | Recommender: You're welcome. Enjoy!\nUser: Hey | User: How are you? | Recommender: Hello there. I'm good. And you? | Recommender: I'd like to recommend a movie for you. What type of movies do you like? | User: I am good, thank you.I'm looking for some good romantic/ rom coms. | User: I love movies like Say Anything... (1989) and You've Got Mail (1998) | User: I like any year, older\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}], "parameters": {"model": "gpt-3.5-turbo", "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "temperature": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0}}}
