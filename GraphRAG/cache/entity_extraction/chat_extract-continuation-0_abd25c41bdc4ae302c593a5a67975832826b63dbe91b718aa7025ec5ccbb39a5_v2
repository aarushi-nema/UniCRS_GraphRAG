Another good one is V for Vendetta  (2005). Have you seen that? | User: yes I have seen that | User: it was a good one too | User: thank you have a great one bye | User: take care | Recommender: You too. Bye.\nRecommender: Hello there | Recommender: What kind of movies do you like to watch?  Any particular genre? | User: Hello! I recently saw The Greatest Showman (2017). I have kids, so do you have any suggestions? | User: We loved that one! | Recommender: I am not familiar with that movie. | Recommender: What kind of movie is it?  If you tell me what it's about I can perhaps think of something along the same style. | User: It is a musical based on a true story. It is about the man and how he got the circus started. It was good. It had good music and good messages. I'm just wondering if you have any good suggestions that kids can enjoy. | Recommender: How about The Music Man  (1962) ? That was a huge hit. | User: Yes. I've seen that. It is really good. | Recommender: A good wholesome movie that your kids can watch with the family. | User: It doesn't have to be a musical either. My kids really enjoyed Thor: Ragnarok (2017) too. | Recommender: And there's also Cecil B. DeMille's epic The Greatest Show on Earth  (1952) | Recommender: That one has some scary moments though | User: I haven't seen that one. I will have to check that one out. Thank you! | User: Thank you for the suggestion. Have a good night. Bye. | Recommender: night!\nRecommender: Hello! How are you ? | User: hello there.  I am good.  Hope you are too. | User: Tell me what kind of movie genre you like! | Recommender: I am thank you! I like action and romantic comedies. I'm not too picky. Out of those two genres, which do you prefer? | User: EIther is good by me.  Which kind did you see most recently? | Recommender: I just saw Star Wars: Episode VIII – The Last Jedi (2017). It was interesting. Have you seen it? | User: I haven't missed any of them since the original Star Wars  (1977) came out | Recommender: Ha! What about Indiana Jones ? | User: Best in the series was The Empire Strikes Back (1980) if it's up to me | Recommender: My brother says so too. | User: I liked pretty much all the Indiana Jones movies... But Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull (2008) was kinda goofy | Recommender: I have to agree. I still loved Harrison Ford in it. | User: I think so too | Recommender: My favorite action movie is probably 3:10 to Yuma  (2007). Have you seen it? | Recommender: It's more of a western. | User: I did see it. And the original 3:10 to Yuma  (1957) | User: Shot for shot, theyre identical. | Recommender: Pretty much. Okay, how about The Last Samurai (2003)? | User: I saw that.  It was good.  I am not a big Tom Cruise fan. | Recommender: Me too, but I really enjoyed that movie. | User: Now I have some movies to rewatch! | Recommender: Okay, have you seen Baby Driver? | User: Never. | Recommender: It's newer and kind of unique. It's a good watch. | User: Thanks so much! | User: See you again I hope! | Recommender: You are welcome. Have a good night. Bye. | Recommender: I think I'm supposed to add Baby Driver  (2017). Sorry...bye! | User: Yes\nUser: Hello there. | User: Tell me about the kind of movies you like! | Recommender: Hello. I enjoy animated movies. How about you? | User: SUre!  What kind are your favorite? | Recommender: I like Studio Ghibli. For example, Howl's Moving Castle . Have you seen that? | User: I have not.  I will check it out though. | User: Did you ever see Lupin III  (2014) | Recommender: It's really good. It is weird, but very unique. I also recently enjoyed Coco  (2017). | Recommender: No, I have never heard of it. What is it about? Did you like it? | User: It's an animated series about a Japanese spy and his spy team.  It's a comedy | User: They go back a long way | Recommender: Do you like animated shows? | User: If you mean like Gnomeo & Juliet (2011) then yes! | Recommender: Yes! That is a good one. There is a new one too. It is pretty fun. It is Gnomeo & Juliet: Sherlock Gnomes (2018). It is in the theaters now. | User: I am going to see it soon! | User: Thanks for the reminder! | Recommender: Sounds good. I hope you enjoy it! Have a good day!
