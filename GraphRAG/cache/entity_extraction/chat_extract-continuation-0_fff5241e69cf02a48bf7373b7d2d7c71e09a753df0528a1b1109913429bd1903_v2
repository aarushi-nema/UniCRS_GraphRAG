I will check those out.  Thank you for the ideas! | Recommender: You're welcome. Have a good night | User: You as well.  Bye.\nUser: Hello. | Recommender: Hello. What sort of movies do you prefer? Is there anything you've watched recently you really enjoyed? | User: I'd like a good movie thats a comedy.  I havne't seen any really good movies lately.  I watched 12 Years a Slave  (2013)  the other day and I love history | Recommender: Have you seen Father Figures (2017) ? It is very new. | User: I havent . | User: The Help  (2011) was a funny and great movie. | Recommender: The Secret Life of Bees  (2008)  is a comedy with a serious theme, sort of similar to The Help  (2011) | User: Thanks .  I'll have to check it out.   Whos in it? | Recommender: Paul Bettany and Tim Burton's wife, that I can't think of the name of right now. | User: Nice thanks for the suggestions.  Have a great night! | Recommender: You too. Good night.\nRecommender: Hello, how are you? | User: Good evening. | User: I'm awesome.  I am looking for a new movie to watch. | Recommender: What kind of movies do you like to watch? | User: I like sweet movies that have a little love and humor in them. | Recommender: Like love stories for example? | User: I seen 50 First Dates (2004) and Pretty Woman (1990) last week | User: Yes.  Mostly like that.  But with a little comedy thrown in. | User: Hello?  Can you help me find one? | Recommender: The Bad Batch (2016) sounds like it might work for you. | Recommender: Then there's How to Talk to Girls at Parties  | Recommender: or The Big Sick (2017). | User: I seen Bad Batch but I haven't seen the other two. | Recommender: Did you like it? | User: Those should work.  Yes I am going to look and see if I can find them. | User: Thank you.  Goodbye | Recommender: Home Again (2017)  is a romantic comedy | Recommender: You're welcome | User: Okay. I will look for Home Again also | Recommender: Yes, it has Reese Witherspoon so it's got to be good.\nUser: Hello. How is your night going? | Recommender: Hi.  It's going great in Kentucky.  How is your evening? | Recommender: I'm here to help you find a movie or two. If that is what you would like. | User: I'm trying to find some movies I'm not familiar with. My movie interested have sort of turned into tunnel vision with Marvel and Star Wars. Absolutely another movie outside of those story arcs is perfect. | User: For example I watched Thor: Ragnarok (2017)  and Rogue One: A Star Wars Story (2016)  recently and that is really it for movies that I've seen in the last few months. | Recommender: LOL, yes there are so many Sci Fi's out there.  I can help you find a comedy or a horror.  Will either of those work for you? | User: Yes. I love horror movies. | Recommender: For example Mother! (2017) was really good.  It was a bit chilling but it left me on the edge of my seat wondering what was going to happen. | User: Is that the movie where there is something like a ghost pursuing the family? I haven't seen it but I've been around other people watching it. | Recommender: The Shining  (1980) ng is a great classic with Jack Nicholson.  I don't think there is any movie that is any scarier. | User: That's a great suggestion. I will definitely watch that one. | Recommender: No, The Mother is about a couple's relationship is tested when uninvited guests arrive at their home, disrupting their tranquil existence. | Recommender: It gets pretty hairy at time because of jealousy | User: I see. That sounds interesting too. | User: I will watch both of those. | Recommender: Sounds great.  I'm glad you liked the recommendations.  Goodbye | User: Thanks for your help. | User: Good night.\nUser: Hi there. | Recommender: Hello, what kind of movies do you like? | User: I'm looking for a Heist movie like The Italian Job  (2003) or Logan Lucky (2017) . | User: I watched Logan Lucky (2017) last night and it was really good. | Recommender: Have you seen Ocean's Thirteen (2007) or any of that series? | User: I have seen the first one, but not the most recent one. | User: Is it any good? | Recommender: Yes, they all are great.  Then there's The Town  (2010) with Ben Affleck. | User: I haven't seen that one either, but I do like Ben Affleck. | Recommender: Inside Man (2006) and Die Hard (1988) are good. | User: I haven't seen Inside Man (2006) , but I have seen Die Hard (1988)  and loved it. | User: I think I'll check out The Town  (2010) and Ocean's Thirteen (2007) .
