I think you might be confusing The War Bride (2001) with Bride Wars (2009). I saw that, it was okay. | Recommender: Oh, did you like Superbad? | User: Yes. | User: Thank you for your suggestions, goodbye! | Recommender: Oh yes you are correct, sorry once again. | Recommender: I hope I helped out. Good bye.\nRecommender: Hello, what type of movie are you interested in? | User: Hi, how are you? | Recommender: I'm well. | User: I want something I can watch at the theater that is a comedy. | Recommender: One moment. | User: I have enjoyed the movies Jack  (1996) which is a classic and Marley & Me  (2008) which is almost heartbreaking. | Recommender: Have you seen Peter Rabbit (2018)? | User: Yes, me and the kids watched that last week.  It was really good. | Recommender: Have you sen Lady Bird  (2017)? | User: But I want to see a movie without the kids tonight. | User: No, I haven't seen Lady Bird yet.  That's a real good idea. | User: It got really good reviews, didn't it? | Recommender: Yes. I'm looking to see what else is in theatres right now comedy-wise. | User: Lady Bird works for me.  I appreciate your time. | Recommender: I still need to give you two more recommenations. | User: Okay.  I'll wait for them. | Recommender: The Greatest Showman (2017) or Jumanji  (2017)? | Recommender: I realize they're not necessarily adult comedies, but may be worth your time. | User: Both were great.  I've seen them both. | Recommender: OK great! | Recommender: Have a lovely evening. | Recommender: Goodbye.\nRecommender: Hello, what kind of movie are you interested in? | User: Hello. | User: Normally I am interested in science fiction or fantasy movies. | Recommender: Have you seen Black Panther (2018) yet? | User: I'm not against other suggestions though.

I haven't missed one yt. | Recommender: Did you like The Witch  (2015)? | User: Yes. It wasn't that great though. I liked the idea of it more than the movie. | Recommender: Did you see Maze Runner: The Death Cure (2018)? | User: I really liked Labyrinth  (1986)  with David Bowie. It's a favorite. | User: No I haven't. | User: I'll check that one out. It sounds good | User: Thank you for the suggestions. I hope you enjoy the rest of your weekend. | Recommender: Did you see Jumanji  (2017)? | User: No. I forgot about it. | User: I'll have to make sure I watch it though. | Recommender: Did you watch The Cloverfield Paradox (2018) on Netflix? | User: No. I had not even heard of it.

Just a second. | Recommender: I'm going to assume you've watched the The Avengers  (2012)  movies so I'll go to something different. Have you seen Justice League: Gods and Monsters (2015) ? | User: I have not seen Justice League, but I have no interest in that. | User: I liked Avengers. Just not into DC movies. | Recommender: Have you seen Con Air (1997)  or Skyfall (2012) ? | Recommender: I see. I'm the same way actually.
