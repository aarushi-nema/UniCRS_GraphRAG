Any other suggestions? | Recommender: Sure, what about Avatar  (2009) ? | User: I did see that fairly recently, and it was amazing! I'll give Independence Day  (1996) a watch. | User: Thanks for the suggestions! | Recommender: Okay! | Recommender: Not a problem. I hope you enjoy it. | User: I will. Bye!\nUser: Hiya! | Recommender: Hello, how are you? | Recommender: What can I help you with today? | User: Good thanks. I want to watch something like Ready Player One  (2018) , or Valerian and the City of a Thousand Planets (2017) | User: A fantasy/sci fi experience | Recommender: those are both good, I could recommend Black Panther (2018)   or maybe even A Quiet Place (2018) if you are looking for newer flicks | User: I watched both, and they are exactly the kind of movie I had in mind. | Recommender: Or maybe even Attack on Titan  (2015)  for something a bit older | User: I haven't heard of that one. Is it sci-fi? | Recommender: Yes, it is a tale of a young person tracking down mysterious monsters. | Recommender: If you are looking for non-stop action I would go with Mad Max: Fury Road (2015) | User: I saw that and it was good. But Attack on Titan  (2015) sounds like fun. I think I'll stream it. | Recommender: In my opinion it is better than the original, are you needing any other suggestions? | User: Thanks for the suggestion! | User: I am all set! Have a good one :) | Recommender: Great, have a nice day\nUser: Hello | Recommender: Hi. What kind of movie can I help you find? | User: I'm looking for a good horror movie, maybe a bit older | User: something like Society  (1989) or From Beyond  (1986) | Recommender: A good older horror has to be Aliens  (1986) , I also love Poltergeist  (1982). Have you seen them? | User: I've seen both of those, they are great.  Any other suggestions? | User: Poltergeist is good, and it doesn't have lots of gore or anything which is nice | User: I've seen all the aliens movies. | Recommender: There is one that always terrified me, so be prepared to be up all ight after watching The Gate  (1987). | User: I haven't seen that one. | User: I'll try The Gate  (1987) thanks for the help.  Take care | Recommender: I might have trouble sleeping after remembering that one :) | Recommender: Enjoy, and have a good night...\nUser: hey hows it going! | Recommender: Hi!

| User: maybe 1 more good movie | Recommender: More recently though I would go with Black Panther (2018), but you should probably watch Captain America: Civil War (2016) to get some background. | User: Oh yes, I have heard good things about those movies | User: I will take your advice on those! | Recommender: You will enjoy them | User: I appreciate the help. | Recommender: have a great day! | User: Thanks, goodbye\nRecommender: hey hows it going | Recommender: Are  you looking into movies?
