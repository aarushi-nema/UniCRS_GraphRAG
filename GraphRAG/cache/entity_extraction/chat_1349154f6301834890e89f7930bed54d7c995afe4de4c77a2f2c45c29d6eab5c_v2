(1980) Tommy Boy (1995) and Men in Black  (1997) | User: Those are all great suggestions! I haven't seen Airplane! (1980)  or Tommy Boy (1995) in years, and I never actually saw Men in Black  (1997) but I always wanted to! | User: The first two are favorites of mine, I love slapstick comedies! | Recommender: You might also like Seven  (1995) for suspense | Recommender: I'm glad you like my picks!
