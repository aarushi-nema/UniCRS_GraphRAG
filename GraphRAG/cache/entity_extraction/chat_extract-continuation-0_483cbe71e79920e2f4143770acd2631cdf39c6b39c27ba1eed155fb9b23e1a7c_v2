What can I help you with? | User: Hello! | User: I'm looking for some good kid friendly movies. | Recommender: Ok, great! | Recommender: I'm sure you may have heard of or watched The Incredibles (2004) | User: We have already seen the classics like Dumbo. | Recommender: They just made a second part | User: Yes we watched the first one not long ago. | User: We have not seen the second part. | Recommender: I heard Coco  (2017) was excellent, and may make you cry. | User: So have I but we have yet to see it. | Recommender: The Emoji Movie (2017) was rated one of the worst of the year, but I've watched it 350 times with my daughter and don't think it's terrible | User: I like watching movies critics dislike because they are usually pretty good. | Recommender: the new Goosebumps  (2015) was pretty good as well | Recommender: That's honestly true alot | User: They have already seen ones like Pokémon: The Movie 2000 (1999) and The Jungle Book  (1967). | User: Really? We haven't seen it but are willing to watch anything safe. | Recommender: Yes! Give it a shot | User: We can do that. | Recommender: Although the newest Jumanji  (2017) is my favorite newer-ish kid-friendly movie | User: I haven't seen the new one. I loved the older one. | Recommender: It really is good haha | Recommender: Hope you enjoy! | User: Isn't the new one the one with Dwayne Johnson and Karen Gilan? | Recommender: Yes. Instead of a board game, it's a video game this time | Recommender: It's funny, action-packed | Recommender: Very good | User: Sounds just as interesting as the original! | Recommender: Hope you have a good day! | User: Thanks for the recommendations! Have a great day! :) | Recommender: Goodbye! | User: Goodbye\nUser: Hello! | Recommender: Hi. What are you here for? | User: I'm looking for a good movie. Any genre except for horror. | User: Any suggestions from something you really like? | Recommender: The last very good movie I saw was Love, Simon (2018). It was very heartfelt and funny.  I also saw The Black Panther  (1977), which was action packed, and Tomb Raider (2018). | Recommender: I also rewatched The Princess Bride  (1987) and it was just as funny as I remembered. | User: Wow. I haven't seen any of those newer ones. Why did you like Love, Simon (2018)? I know the critics gave it pretty good reviews, but some people I know thought it was just okay. | User: Ha, that last one is a classic. I used to watch it when I was little! | Recommender: I think  Love, Simon (2018) felt more like a classic coming of age movie. There weren't any fancy effects, and it was simple, but that's why I liked it. It really stood out among the current movies that all have CGI or overdone plots. | User: That's true. I'll have to see it. | Recommender: It went back to basics, which was really refreshing. | Recommender: I hope I suggested some things you can watch. | User: I recently watched Larry Crowne (2011) which is kind of like that. Just simple but a good story. | User: Yes. Thank you! I'll have to watch those. | Recommender: I haven't seen that, I'll check it out. | User: Have a good day! | Recommender: You too! | User: Bye!\nUser: HI!
