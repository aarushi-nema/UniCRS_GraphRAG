I'm glad I could help build your list a little bit ;) | Recommender: I hope you enjoy them all as well! I sure did! | User: Thank you! :) | User: I will! | Recommender: You're welcome! | Recommender: Take care now! :-) | User: You too.\nUser: Hello! | Recommender: Hey. What kind of movies can I help you with today? | User: I'm really interested in finding a movie that's funny, but not a comedy. Do you have any thoughts? | Recommender: Hmmm | Recommender: Shaun of the Dead (2004) is sort of a horror movie turned into a funny one | User: Yes something like that! I enjoyed Shaun of the Dead (2004) . Same thing with Get Out (2017), funny, but not really a comedy. | Recommender: The new Jumanji  (2017) was funny as well, but I think would fit more in the action category | Recommender: I see what you mean. Get Out (2017) did have its funny parts. | User: I haven't seen the new Jumanji  (2017) yet, I heard that it was surprisingly good. So, I will need to watch it. | Recommender: It is! Instead of a board game, they base it around a video game. | User: I like movies with The Rock, he's a fun actor. Do you have any other recommendations that he is in? | Recommender: Oh certainly. Did you know he was the voice for a lead role in the animated movie Moana  (2016)? | User: Moana  (2016) is great! I loved hearing him sing. | User: It sounds like you have good taste, so, I will definitely check out the new Jumanji  (2017). Thank you! | Recommender: Great! Hope you enjoy!

Some favorites of mine are 8 Heads in a Duffel Bag (1997) | User: Home Alone (1990) | User: Mean Girls (2004) | User: The Green Mile  (1999) | User: and The Shawshank Redemption (1994) | Recommender: All of those are great movies! | User: I'm glad you agree, I tend to think so too! | Recommender: If you like sci fi The Darkest Hour  (2011)  and Terminator Genisys (2015) were both good. | User: Alright, thanks! I haven't heard of The Darkest Hour  (2011) or Terminator Genisys (2015) so I'll look both of them up tonight! | Recommender: For romcoms Monster-in-Law (2005) and Silver Linings Playbook (2012) are good choices. | Recommender: Awesome.I like them a lot. | User: Oh, I've seen Silver Linings Playbook (2012) and forgot about it! What a great film! I'll definitely look into Monster-in-Law (2005) as well, as I may or may not have seen that one (ashton kutcher?) | User: But either way, I love romcoms too! Thank you for all of the wonderful suggestions! | User: :-) | Recommender: If you like European movies there is Not Another Happy Ending (2013) a Scottish romcom. | User: This makes my movie watching for the week a little easier ;) | User: I do, that sounds really intriguing! | Recommender: Glad I could help. | User: thanks again! | Recommender: No problem. | User: Take care :-)\nRecommender: Hello!
