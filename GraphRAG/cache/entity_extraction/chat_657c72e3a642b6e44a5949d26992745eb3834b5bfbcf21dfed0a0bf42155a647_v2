(2008). | User: We love The Lion King (1994) in this house. And neither of us has seen Our School's E.T. (2008) , so we will give that a shot as well. | User: Thanks, my daughter will be so happy to see some new movies. | Recommender: Whoops wrong one I meant E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial (1982). Sorry. | User: LoL. That's okay. We will watch both :-) | User: Have a nice day. Bye now.\nRecommender: Hi | Recommender: Can I recommend a movie today? | User: Hi yes please. I am looking for a movie similar to Airplane! (1980). | User: I love a good classic comedy. | Recommender: Great!  Have you seen Lethal Weapon (1987) ? | User: No I have not what is it about. | Recommender: Monty Python and the Holy Grail (1975) is one of my favorites | User: That one is great. Especially how they do the coconuts for the horses. | Recommender: Lethal Weapon has Mel Gibson and has some police/action type things happening, but is a comedy, too | User: oh that does sound interesting. I love Mel Gibson in Signs  (2002). | Recommender: Maybe The Naked Gun ? It is a parody of detective movies | User: Yes the last one is what I am going to watch tonight. | User: Thank you so much. | User: Bye. | Recommender: I also loved Hot Shots! Part Deux (1993)\nRecommender: Hello! :) | User: Hi! I am looking for a drama to watch | Recommender: How may I help you today? | Recommender: Have you seen The Godfather (1972) and Titanic  (1997)? | Recommender: If you like Tom Hanks there is Saving Private Ryan (1998) and Forrest Gump (1994). | User: Yes. I didn't really like Titanic  (1997) . I've never seen The Godfather (1972) | User: Yes! I love Tom Hanks and have seen both of those movies. | Recommender: The is also Rocky (1976) and The Shawshank Redemption (1994). | User: I don't like the Rocky (1976) movies, but I did hear that The Shawshank Redemption (1994) was good. I started watching it before and wanted to finish it. | User: Thanks for the reminder. | User: I will watch that. | Recommender: Also All About Eve (1950) and Prisoners  (2013). | Recommender: It was great! | User: Awesome. I've not seen wither of those movies either. Will check them out. | User: Thanks. Have a great day. Bye now.\nRecommender: Hello there! | User: Hi. I am looking for movies that star Jake Gyllenhaal. | Recommender: He's done a lot of good movies.  Have you ever seen Zodiac  (2007) ?  It was a thriller movie. | User: I don't think I have. I will definitely check it out. He is one of my favorites. I really liked the movie Nightcrawler  (2014) | Recommender: If you liked Nightcrawler  (2014) I bet you would like Zodiac  (2007) just as much, or even more! | User: Can you think of anything else that he has been in? | Recommender: What about Prisoners  (2013)?  He plays a detective. | User: I haven't seen that either, but I heard someone talking about it earlier today and it sounded really good. I will definitely add that to my list. | User: Someone was also telling me about Southpaw  (2015) . | Recommender: Another suspense movie he did was End of Watch (2012) | User: Thanks for the movie suggestions. I will definitely be watching Zodiac  (2007) and Prisoners  (2013) | User: Yes End of Watch (2012) was a good one too. | User: Thank you so much. Bye now.

Have you ever seen Legends of the Fall (1994) ? | User: No I have not. What is it about. | Recommender: It's about two brothers that fall in love with the same woman. It's a good show. | Recommender: Also this may sound weird by have you seen The Twilight Saga  ? That reminds me of Romeo and Juliet. | User: I loved the Twilight Saga but I have only seen the first one but read the books. | Recommender: Oh! Seeing the rest is a must. Never as good as the books, but good! | Recommender: Have you seen Cyrano de Bergerac  (1990) | User: I saw the broadway version but never the movie. | Recommender: The movie is good, but probably not as good as a broadway show. | User: And I will check out the rest in the series. I am just usually hesitant of sequels and prequels. | User: You have been helpful thanks. | Recommender: You won't regret it.
