How can I help you today? | User: Can you help me choose a disney movie? | Recommender: Of course! Is there any particular interest you have in a Disney movie so that I can pair you with one best fit for you? | User: I like to sing along | User: so good music is a must | Recommender: Great! I know many people enjoy Mulan (1998) as a classic disney film which features many song tracks to sing along to! | User: I did see that one, but it's been a long time. | User: And I remember the music was good. | User: Let's keep thinking, but keep that as a maybe. | Recommender: It has been a while since it's original release. If you're interested in a more modern one, Frozen (2013) has been especially popular with fans of disney soundtracks! | User: I really enjoyed that. | User: But we've seen it a lot. | User: I am looking for something I don't already have memorized. | User: We also really enjoyed Tangled (2010) | Recommender: Sure, no problem! Are you looking for something more modern then, like Tangled? Or a classic? Because if it's classic and something I'm sure isn't too memorized, I can suggest Fantasia (1940) as Walt DIsney's third major disney film! It's mainly about Mickey Mouse and includes a wide range of classical tracks! | Recommender: However, if something like Tangled (2010) is more of your taste, I highly recommend Coco  (2017). It has been extremely popular lately! | User: Fantasia (1940) is a good idea | Recommender: Glad I could help!
