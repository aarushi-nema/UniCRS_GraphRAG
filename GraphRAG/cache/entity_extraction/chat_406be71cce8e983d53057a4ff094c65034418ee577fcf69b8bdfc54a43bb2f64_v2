I like a lot of them. | Recommender: Don't Breathe (2016) is good. | User: What about one like The Amityville Haunting (2011) ? | User: Well, I think I got enough to scare the pants off me for a while. | User: Goodbye and I really thank you for your help! | Recommender: No problem.\nUser: Oi Oi Ello! | Recommender: hello! | Recommender: What sort of movies are you into? | User: Well, Big on the comedy aspect I reckon. I fancy the intense over the top flicks like The Hangover (2009) and Project X  (2012) | Recommender: I like the first one. | Recommender: I enjoyed Hangover  (2014) | User: Good flick there yeah. Know any other right okay ones? | Recommender: I do not know what that means. | Recommender: Oh, maybe Juno (2007) | Recommender: Do you know any like that one? | User: That was an alright flick I reckon. Umm maybe 500 Days of Summer sort of reminds me of it there. | Recommender: I did not see that one. | Recommender: It has the girl from Elf  (2003)  right? | Recommender: If you like that one, I would go for something like Superbad  (2007) | User: Haha, Ive actually never seen Elf  (2003) . Loved Superbad  (2007) bit overplayed now for me at this point though. | Recommender: Or even Mr. Mom (1983) if you are into the 80's | Recommender: Ahh, maybe 21 Jump Street  (2012) ? | User: Both good flicks there. Thanks. Havent seen Mr. Mom (1983) in ages ill have to check that flick out again soon. heh | Recommender: Well, I hope I helped a bit.

You've asked the right person, haha. | User: I am a fan of the great Spock and all his appearances in the Star Trek  franchise. | User: Though, I am lacking in a a few of them. I only recently started watching the movies, only seen one or two of the franchise. | User: But like all sci-fi. Share you wisdom of sci-fi movies please. | Recommender: A person with great taste, I can recommend you last years Blade Runner 2049 (2017) , but you should definitely see the very first movie of it which was Blade Runner (1982) | User: I have seen neither. | User: Are they very big on lore? | Recommender: Yes, they sure are, and if you're a big fan of getting to know the movie or appreciating the movie by your own speculations and analysis, I would recommend both. | Recommender: But if you want something more casual but still Sci fi, Cowboy Bebop: The Movie (2001) is a movie I would recommend, although animated, space adventure with a bunch of bounty hunters is simply good. | User: I have never saw that one either! | User: The name reminds me of Blazing Saddles (1974) | Recommender: Lol, go see all of them my friend, well that's it, hope you have a good one! | User: Thank you so much I will get into this soon. | User: Cheers!\nUser: Hello! | User: How are you today? | Recommender: I am doing great! | User: That's great! | Recommender: I hope you like movies, I sure do!
