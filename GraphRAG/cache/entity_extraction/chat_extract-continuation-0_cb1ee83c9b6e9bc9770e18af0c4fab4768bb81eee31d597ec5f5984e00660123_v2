I was worried it would bomb. | Recommender: haven't seen it yet. I saw the first one with tim curry when I was younger and had nightmares | Recommender: well nice chatting with you | User: Tim Curry gives me nightmares in general. | Recommender: haha\nUser: Morning! | Recommender: hi there | Recommender: what movies do you like? | Recommender: what genre | User: I like everything, but this morning I'm in the mood for drama. | User: Political dramas I should say. | Recommender: okay how about Warrior  (2007) | Recommender: Good Will Hunting (1997) | Recommender: Forrest Gump (1994) | User: Never seen Warrior  (2007) .

Which older films? | User: Films like The Asphalt Jungle (1950)  and Murder, My Sweet | User: How was Elf  (2003) ? | Recommender: Those sounds like great movies. Are they mysteries? Have you watched Dr. Seuss' How the Grinch Stole Christmas  (2000) ? Yes, Elf was good!! | User: Yes they're mysteries. A little dark in the sense of tone, but not content. Very good if you're into that sort of thing. | User: And I've not see that version of the Dr. Seuss tale. With Jim Carrey right? | Recommender: Yes. It was also a good movie.

And various things go wrong. It is a comedy. | User: Sounds like it might be good. And with Tim Allen I'm sure the comedy is witty. :D | Recommender: He is a great actor.
