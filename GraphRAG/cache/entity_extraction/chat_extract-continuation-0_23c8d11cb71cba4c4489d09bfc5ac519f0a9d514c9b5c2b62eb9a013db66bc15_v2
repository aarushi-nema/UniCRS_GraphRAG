The Thing  (1982) comes to mind | Recommender: The Thing  (2011) is good too | User: Oh, yes.  I just felt chills thinking about that.  LOL. | User: Maybe even a Christmas movie? | Recommender: maybe even National Lampoon's Christmas Vacation (1989) | User: Something like Elf  (2003) ? | Recommender: Jingle All the Way (1996) is pretty wonderful for that genre! | User: I love National Lampoon's Christmas Vacation (1989) and my son is always up for that. | User: I haven't seen Jingle All the Way (1996) .  I'll look it up! | Recommender: Snow Day  (2000) is a fun one for kids | Recommender: Hopefully I helped! | User: Those are great suggestions!  You did help. | User: You have a great afternoon!
