How about something like Porky's (1981)? | Recommender: My husband and I re-watched Police Academy  (1984)  recently.  It really is a hoot and makes for a fun nostalgic trip. | User: Oh yes, I love Porky's (1981) | User: Omg, I am definitely going to rewatch Police Academy  (1984) | Recommender: Of course, Sixteen Candles (1984) is silly and campy.  Love Molly Ringwald. | User: Can't go wrong with that one either. | User: Great, thanks for the options! | User: Have a great day. Goodbye! | Recommender: I was a teenager in the 80's so I have a ton of them.  You're welcome!  Goodbye!\nUser: Hi how are you | User: What type of movies do you like | Recommender: Hello!  What kind of movies are you into?  I'm good, I hope you are well, too. | User: Thank you I am :) I enjoy action and comedy!! | User: Know of any good ones ?! | Recommender: Sure!  If you are into action, I'd recommend seeing Beverly Hills Cop (1984) . | User: Oh yesss that was a great movie !!! | User: Have you seen Inception (2010) | Recommender: If you want more action than that, you could see Avengers: Infinity War (2018) | Recommender: I haven't seen Inception (2010) .  I keep meaning to see it. | User: Ohh! Is it good?! I heard so many mix reviews | User: It’s super good!! | User: Definately have to watch it !! | Recommender: I liked Avengers Grimm (2015) .  Also, The Dark Knight  (2008)  is great for edge-of-your-seat action. | Recommender: I meant to say I liked Avengers: Infinity War (2018) | User: Exactly !!! I totally agree! Did you see Black Panther (2018)  I really liked it | User: I send it 3 times ! | Recommender: Oh, and comedy and action should get you to see Deadpool 2  (2018) | User: I haven’t seen the first one or second of deadpool | Recommender: I haven't caught Black Panther (2018)  yet, but plan to very soon at home. | Recommender: Deadpool  (2016)  is not for the kids, but it is funny. | User: Yess!

Any suggestions? | Recommender: Monster  (2003) is pretty good! | User: It could also be a modern version of an old fashioned monster movie, or something that has them in it.  For example, The Cabin in the Woods is a good example of a modern monster movie. | Recommender: Pacific Rim  (2013) | User: Well, Monster  (2008)  isn't really the type of movie I was looking for.  Isn't that the one with Charleze Theron? | Recommender: Is really good | Recommender: Yes ! | User: I haven't seen Pacific Rim  (2013) .
