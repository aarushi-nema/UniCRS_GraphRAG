Did you see that? Sadly, I din't think the creators went on to much success with other films. | Recommender: Yikes. The drop down menu has that misspelled! | User: Ehh....I lived in a small town when The Blair Witch Project (1999) came out and by the time it made it to our theater I'd already seen all the parodies of it.  And it was in a theater full of people who screamed and freaked out.  I think If I'd seen it earlier then I'd have liked it. | User: LOL | Recommender: That's an interesting timeline. I had never thought of the time effect. Should we say good-bye? | User: I wasn't really a fan of Paranormal Activity (2007) either.  Yes, I think so.  This is my first time doing these, so I'm still learning the process. | Recommender: Me too. I am very jet lagged from returning from a vacation in Asia so my thinking skills might be a bit impaired. | User: Well, it was nice talking to you.  Get some rest and have a good day. | Recommender: You were a lot of fun and made my tired brain think! Have a great day! Bye!\nUser: hello! | Recommender: Hi! | Recommender: How are you? | User: Do you have any good kids movies? | Recommender: I think I do.  How old are the kids in question? | User: My twins are 5 and my youngest is almost 3 | Recommender: Boys, girls, mixture? | User: All girls but they are not picky. They love Batman Forever (1995)  AND My Little Pony: The Movie  (2017) | Recommender: How do you feel about Japanese animation?  Specifically Miyazaki films?  Because I'm thinking My Neighbor Totoro | Recommender: I think it has a good message about family with a whimsical nature. | User: I dont think they have seen these | Recommender: Oh hey, about Totoro, there are actually two dubs for it, a Fox dub (done in the late 1980's) and a Disney dub (done in the mid-2000s).  Both are appropriate for children (but my preference is the Fox dub). | User: interesting | Recommender: You said they enjoyed Batman Forever (1995) , how do you feel about The Lego Batman Movie (2017) ? | User: I think my husband enjoyed that one more than they did lol | Recommender: No worries, lol.  :) | User: Thank you for all you help. HAve a great morning\nUser: hi | Recommender: Good morning. | Recommender: Is there a particular type of movie you are interested in? | User: I like Romance movies | Recommender: Are you a fan of Fifty Shades of Grey  (2015) ? | User: Absoutely, have seen them all so far | Recommender: I cannot wait for Fifty Shades Freed  (2018) . | User: Me to, its gonna be great. They really know what thier doing by having a Valentine release always | Recommender: If you would like to revisit classics, Tom Hanks and Meg Ryan are both amazing in You've Got Mail (1998) and Sleepless in Seattle (1993) . Both are very sweet romantic movies. | Recommender: Oh I definitely agree. Counting down to Valentine's Day :) | User: Yes they are, I have seen those as well. Love the classics | Recommender: A Walk to Remember (2002) and The Notebook (2013)  are really romantic Nicholas Sparks movies. | User: A walk to remember was so sad | Recommender: Yes it was but showed what true love is. | User: Definitely | Recommender: Hope my suggestions were helpful. Perhaps it is a day to revisit a classic romance? | User: Perhaps it is,  Have a great day\nRecommender: Good morning! | User: Morning! | Recommender: How are you today? | User: I'm swell. You? | Recommender: Shiny, thank you!  What can I help you find today? | User: Any good recommendations for drama movies? I'm out of the loop when it comes to those right now | Recommender: I've been a little behind on Drama, admittedly, but I think I've got a few for you. | Recommender: Are you into historical dramas, uplifting dramas? | User: Great! Umm lets go with historical dramas | Recommender: If you're into war films about pragmatic duty with an uplifting ending, Dunkirk  (2017) is really good. | User: I will definitely look into it. I haven't even heard of that one! | User: Do you know any good romance movies? | Recommender: I do.  Are you looking for something more recent, because my go-to for Romance is usually Shakespeare? | Recommender: But I can do a recent recommendation. | User: It doesn't matter! Have you watched the Romeo + Juliet (1996) with Leonardo DiCaprio? I liked it but I swear the whole ending where she literally opened her eyes and saw him drink the poison was just crazy lol | Recommender: Romeo + Juliet (1996) is the reason I auditioned for Tybalt last year.  I didn't get it, but I still got a fun part. | User: That's awesome! | Recommender: Okay, romance movies!
