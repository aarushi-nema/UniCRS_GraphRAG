It was ridiculously funny. | User: I agree with that one too! Not only is James Franco funny, he's quite a hunk. | Recommender: And much to my surprise I also enjoyed Neighbors  (2014). | Recommender: Speaking of hunks... | User: Oh I actually haven't seen that yet! Isn't there a sequel too? | Recommender: Zac Efron is in that with him, and is actually really funny. And yes there is a sequel. | Recommender: But the original is funnier. | User: Great suggestion! I will definitely have to watch that. Thank you! | Recommender: You are welcome. Enjoy! | User: Goodbye!\nUser: Hi there! I'm looking for movies that include a love story straight out of a dream. | User: Like The Notebook (2004) | Recommender: Hi! I love those Nicholas Sparks movies. Have you watched The Choice  (2016)? It's a beautiful picture. | User: No, never even heard of it. | User: Titanic  (1997) is a pretty good one too. Classic. | Recommender: I can never watch that movie again, it makes me cry too much! | User: I'll take any tear-jerker recommendations too! | Recommender: Well the original romantic movie, and still one of the best has to be Love Story  (1970).

I'll have to watch! | Recommender: Definately, my mum made me watch it and I loved it! | User: 10 Things I Hate About You (1999) is another good one! | Recommender: Yes it is, loved Heath Ledger.

I have heard good things. | User: Oh, I think I saw the cover of that | User: Thank you for the recommendation | Recommender: Inside Out  (2015) was good too. After young Riley is uprooted from her Midwest life and moved to San Francisco, her emotions - Joy, Fear, Anger, Disgust and Sadness - conflict on how best to navigate a new city, house, and school. | User: Oh, I liked that one a lot | Recommender: And definitely Up  (2009).
