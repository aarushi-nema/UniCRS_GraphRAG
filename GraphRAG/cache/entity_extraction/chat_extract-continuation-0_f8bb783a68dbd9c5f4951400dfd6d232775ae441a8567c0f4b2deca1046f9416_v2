It reminds me of Shallow Hal (2001) | Recommender: I definitely recommend that one if you haven't seen | Recommender: Also Forgetting Sarah Marshall (2008) is similar to those | User: I haven't seen Gran Torino (2008)  but I love Shallow Hal (2001) | User: Thank you, you've given me some really good movies to check out! | Recommender: I hope you like my suggestions!! It was really great chatting with you and have a great rest of the weekend!\nRecommender: hey there | User: Hi! | Recommender: What type of films are you into? | User: I like funny, dramas, or action movies. | Recommender: Oh great!

A drama I love is The Godfather (1972) | Recommender: My favorite action movie is Crank  (2006) | Recommender: I'd definitely recommend any of those if you haven't seen | User: I enjoyed The Godfather (1972), But I haven't saw the others. My favorite action movies are The Fast and the Furious  (2001) | Recommender: Never seen any of those!! I think Star Wars  (1977) might be a good suggestion if you like those. It may seem like an odd comparison but they both are fun high energy franchises with big fan bases. (and lots of films.) lol | User: I keep saying that I'm going to give Star Wars a try, just haven't got around to it yet. | Recommender: Also another car film I saw and kind of liked was Torque  (2004). It's not much talked about, but I quite enjoyed it | User: Car movies are definitely a favorite of mine, i think I was a racer in a past life or something. | Recommender: lmao. I'd also suggest Talladega Nights: The Ballad of Ricky Bobby (2006) if you haven't seen! Super funny! | Recommender: Hope you like my suggestions pal!

Just so many ither good films like Baby Driver  (2017) and Dunkirk  (2017) came out | Recommender: well im sure you will find something good - The Shape of Water  (2017) is getting a lot of good press | User: I saw that yesterday, but wasn't the biggest fan!! Thanks for your help pal! Enjoy the rest of your day! | Recommender: you too!\nRecommender: Good afternoon! | Recommender: What type of movie(s) do you like? | User: Hello. I normally enjoy the comic based movies but I am trying to watch other things as well since I've been ignoring other genres. | Recommender: Awesome!  I love comic book movies | Recommender: What is your favorite?  I think mine to date is still Captain America: The Winter Soldier | User: My favorite would probably be Captain America: Civil War (2016) | Recommender: Which really surprised me because I wasn't a huge fan of Captain America: The First Avenger | Recommender: I also loved Civil War | User: I wasn't either. I thought the first Captain America was very boring. I have not watched Justice League  (2017) . Do you have any experience with that? | Recommender: I haven't seen any DC movie since Suicide Squad  (2016) took 2 hours of my life | Recommender: Ok!  I think we're done here!  I'm gonna do this a couple more times, so I hope to speak to you again!  Take care | User: Thanks.
