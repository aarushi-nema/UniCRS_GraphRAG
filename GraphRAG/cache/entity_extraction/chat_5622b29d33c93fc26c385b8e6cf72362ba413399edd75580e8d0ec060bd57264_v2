I was overweight in my early 20s and it brought back so many memories. | Recommender: Oh, yeah. It was awful. She had to deal with so much. What about Extremely Loud and Incredibly Close  (2011). Another good Sandra Bullock film. | User: Is that the one based on the novel of the same name? | Recommender: I'm not sure. It's about an autistic boy who loses his father on 9/11. | User: Yeah that's the one. I've read the book and loved it but I've never seen the movie. | Recommender: It's very sad, but very good. | User: I can only imagine.
