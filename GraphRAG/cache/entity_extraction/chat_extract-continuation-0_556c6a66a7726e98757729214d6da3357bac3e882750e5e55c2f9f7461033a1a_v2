Has Wesley Snipers in drag lol | Recommender: Kingsman: The Secret Service (2014) is the superior movie, admittedly. However, both are worth watching. | User: Ah, haha | User: That is hilarious | User: i'm sure I'll enjoy it.  Thank you for the recommenation. | Recommender: It is actually a good movie.
