Night Shamalan, and not super suspenseful, but I loved the story. | Recommender: I think I remember hearing that it is based on a bed time story he told his kids. | User: Interesting. | Recommender: You should check it out. | User: I should.

How are you? | Recommender: Is there anything in particular you are looking for, or should I just start naming movies I like and why? | User: Go for it. | Recommender: Well, to start, I'd like the recommend The Matrix (1999) for it's sci-fi themes, though it's better to think of people as computers as it was originally intended. | User: One of my favorites. | Recommender: If you're looking for some action Iron Man  (2008) has perhaps the best mix of music and action with it's Black Sabbath scene. | Recommender: Patema Inverted is an animated feature that is great for questioning your own biases. | User: I have never heard of that one. | Recommender: The Shadow  (1994) is a great (corny) film if you want to watch Alec Baldwin as a &quot;dark&quot; superhero. | User: I remember that one. I had completely forgotten about that. Alec is great, I loved him as Jack Donaghy on 30Rock | Recommender: He's a great straight-man kind of comedic actor. | User: So true | User: Well thanks, this is a great list. | User: Have a great day! | Recommender: Well, that's a list that should get you going.

I've been meaning to watch it.  I saw the movie Get Him to the Greek (2010) which shares some of the same actors | Recommender: Get Him to the Greek is somewhat of a quasi-sequel to Forgetting Sarah Marshall haha. I also highly recommend the film Superbad  (2007). I re-watched it recently and was honestly surprised by how well written it was. | User: I love Superbad  (2007) .  I also really love the movie This Is the End (2013) | Recommender: Those are both great comedy films, I agree! | User: Okay, I will watch Forgetting Sarah Marshall (2008) this weekend. Any other movie suggestions for me? | Recommender: Well, if you're into more drawn out classics and enjoy foreign films, I highly recommend anything by Andrei Tarkovsky, such as his epic film Stalker  (1979). | User: Oh really? I am familiar with that director, as I love the movie Solaris  (1972) .  I will definitely check out that movie as well.
