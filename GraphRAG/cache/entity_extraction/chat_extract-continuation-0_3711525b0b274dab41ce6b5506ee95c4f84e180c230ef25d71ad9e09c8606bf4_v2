What kind of movie are you looking for? | User: I'm looking for family friendly comedies | User: Cartoons or real people is fine | Recommender: Ok!  Have you seen The Boss Baby (2017) ?  I thought it would be much worse than it was! | Recommender: It was actually sort of amusing. | User: Yes! That was pretty funny | Recommender: I would also recommend Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2 (2017)  - pretty funny for a super hero movie! | User: Okay! I've heard a lot about that movie but haven't gotten around to seeing it | Recommender: My children and I also enjoyed The Lego Batman Movie (2017) ! | User: Oh yeah that's a hilarious movie | Recommender: Although I have yet to see The Lego Ninjago Movie (2017) I imagine it will be pretty darn funny. | User: That's on our to-see list also. I'll check out Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2 (2017) ! Thanks! | Recommender: you are welcome!\nRecommender: HI what kind of movie do you wan to see? | User: Hello. Are you familiar with horror movies at all? | Recommender: Yes, gory like A Nightmare on Elm Street (1984) ? Or more psychological like The Exorcist  (1973) ? | User: Either. I enjoy both. My mom and I watch them. I really liked The Cabin in the Woods | User: I liked the original The Exorcist  (1973) but it literally gave me nightmares as a child. | Recommender: The Babadook (2014) is quite frightening. Or Train to Busan (2016) if you like zombies | User: I will definitely check out the zombie suggestion. I love zombie movies. The Babadook (2014)  was great. | Recommender: The Wailing  (2016) is also a scary korean film | User: I'll look at that one too. Thank you so much for your help. I have a couple completely new ones to watch now. | Recommender: You are welcome | Recommender: Have a nice day | User: You too.\nUser: Hey there | Recommender: Hi!  What sort of movie are you looking for? | User: I am interested in scary movies | Recommender: You are in luck because I love scary movies!  Have you seen The Babadook (2014) yet? | User: No, I haven't even heard of it! | User: I just looked it up and it looks good | Recommender: It was!  You should also check out The Witch  (2015).  It was surprisingly good. | User: That looks like a good one too! | Recommender: I would also recommend Martyrs  (2016) if you do not mind gory gory movies. | Recommender: It is pretty graphic. | User: Haha, okay, I might not be able to get through Martyrs  (2016) | Recommender: tucker and dale vs evil was funny and scary simultaneously. It  (2017) was pretty good! | User: I've heard a lot about It  (2017) . I read the book and liked it so I definitely need to watch the movie. | User: Thanks for all the suggestions! | Recommender: Of course!  Good bye!\nRecommender: Hello. Are you searching for anything specific? | User: Hey!  I just watched Wonder Woman  (2017) and am seeking other strong female lead movies! | User: Any suggestions? | Recommender: The first movie that came to mind is actually Resident Evil  (2002)  but that isn't really the same thing. I'll think about it for a second. | Recommender: Have you ever seen Black Swan  (2010) ? | User: I saw that movie and thought it was pretty good.  Never played the game too much, though! | User: I did and I enjoyed it! | Recommender: Same here. I didn't really like the game.

I like the director quite a bit. | Recommender: I have heard a lot about that. I don't pay much attention to directors but I know that movie is up for a bunch of awards. | User: Thank you for reminding me of that movie!

I've enjoyed a lot of the more recent super hero movies.  Wonder Woman  (2017) was amazing. | Recommender: Oh me too!! | Recommender: I am especially excited about Black Panther (2018) | User: Yes it was. I loved that Gal Gadot was the star.
