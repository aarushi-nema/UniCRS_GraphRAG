I agree that it's good! | Recommender: A sci fi one with a bit of romance I would recommend would be the new Star Trek Beyond (2016) They are doing an awesome job with these new ones. | User: Great, I haven't seen that one!  I have seen the older Star Trek  (2009) movies.  Up through 4, I think.  So I might like Star Trek Beyond (2016). | Recommender: Okay great.  I'm glad I was able to help.  I'm gonna finish up with my friend so I'll TTYL. Goodbye. | User: Bye!\nUser: Hello. | Recommender: Hi there. | Recommender: Are you looking for a movie in a particular genre? | User: How is your night going so far? I just watched The Ring  (2017)  and now I would like to find some more good horror movies. | User: If you aren't a fan of that genre though some good drama movies would be fine too. | Recommender: My night is going pretty well.  Hang on a second, and I can suggest some movies for you. | User: Ok. Cool. Thank you. | Recommender: Have you seen Get Out (2017) or Happy Death Day  (2017)?  Both newer movies. | User: I have not seen either of those although I have heard of the first one. I will check them out. | Recommender: And there is also the remake of It  (2017), which is good. | User: I can't believe I forgot about that movie. I've been looking forward to it coming out on DVD. | User: Thank you for the suggestions. I will definitely be watching It  (2017) | Recommender: You're welcome. | Recommender: Have a great night! | User: you too!\nUser: Hi there | Recommender: Hi!  How is your evening going? | User: It's going great.  I'm a bit bored and looking for a movie though. | Recommender: What kind of movie are you in the mood for? | User: I don't want anything action packed tonight.  I kinda want something boring, lol, something to help relax me and get me ready for sleep | Recommender: A boring movie, huh?  LOL.  Can you give me an example or two of the kind you're looking for? | User: I think something like Cinderella  (2015) or The Princess Diaries  (2001) would be just the thing | Recommender: Well, if you like princess movies, there is Ella Enchanted  (2004). | User: Oh that does sound good.  Can you give me one more just in ? | Recommender: Or Enchanted  (2007), too.  Great Disney movie. | Recommender: Or The Prince and Me (2004).  That one is always fun. | User: Those sound awesome.  I'm gonna let you go and see if I can find those.  Thanks for the help. Goodbye | Recommender: Okay, bye!\nUser: Hello. | Recommender: Hi, how's it going? | User: Good. Yourself? | Recommender: Also good. | User: I was hoping to get some recommendations on some newer movies. | Recommender: Okay, give me just a second. | User: It doesn't have to be this year, perhaps 2-3 years old as well. | User: Ok. | Recommender: Do you like animated movies?  Coco  (2017) is a newer movie and really cute. | User: Sure. Some animated films are great. I loved Finding Nemo (2003) | User: I haven't seen your suggestion but I'll look into it. | Recommender: Or there is Jumanji  (2017).  It would be as good as the original, except it doesn't have Robin Williams. :( | User: Yes you are right about that. It was very sad when that news came out. I will make sure to watch that movie as well. | User: I really liked Robin Williams in Schindler's List (1993) | Recommender: If you like comedy, you could try Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri (2017). | User: I've heard of that. I'll definitely be watching. Thank you for your help | Recommender: I think I liked Robin Williams in everything he was ever in.  One of the greats. | Recommender: Okay, have a good night! | User: You too. Thanks a bunch!\nUser: Hi! | Recommender: Hello. Is there any specific type of movie you enjoy? | User: I really like romantic comedies.  I really liked The Holiday (2006) and Fools Rush In  (1997).  Do you have anything like that you can recommend? | Recommender: Have you ever seen Marley & Me  (2008) ? I know it had a bit of a serious life situation but it was also a comedy. | Recommender: The Family Stone (2005)  was a good Romantic comedy. Very lighthearted. | User: I haven't seen that!  I read the book, but I didn't ever see the movie.  I'll have to check it out! | Recommender: Awesome. I didn't even know it was a book. I'll have to read that now. | User: I have heard of The Family Stone (2005),\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}], "parameters": {"model": "gpt-3.5-turbo", "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "temperature": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0}}}
