I have not seen the other two. Are they funny? | Recommender: Yes!. Bill Murray is in Caddyshack (1980) as well. I'd see that one before The Hangover (2009) | Recommender: If you like British humor, Monty Python and the Holy Grail (1975) is hilarious | User: I love Bill Murray! I will for sure check it out. And I do enjoy some British humor, so Monty Python and the Holy Grail (1975) will be on my list to watch too. | User: I have a lot to check out! | User: Thanks for all the suggestions! | Recommender: No problemo! bye. :) | User: Bye!\nRecommender: Hi, I hear you are looking for movies? | User: Hello! | User: Yes! I am interested in some good comedies. | User: Such as Deadpool  (2016) or Superbad  (2007) , those are two of my favorites. | Recommender: Anchorman: The Legend of Ron Burgundy (2004) is a really good movie. | Recommender: The Big Sick (2017) Was hilarious as well | User: I have not seen either- what are they about? | Recommender: Anchorman is about an anchorman in the 70's dealing with a new female coworker, and his attemps to outshine her. | Recommender: The Big Sick (2017) is about a Pakistani Man who falls in love with a white American woman.

I saw one about climbing Mount Everest but I forget the name | User: I'll have to check it out | Recommender: or That's It, That's All  is a snowboarding movie, if you wanna see winter stuff. | Recommender: Alive  (1993) is survival movie based on a true story, about a rugby team that gets stranded after a plane crash, if that interests you. | Recommender: So since you like that one, | Recommender: Check out Everest  (2015) | User: I actually saw both of those before and enjoyed them, being an avid snowboarder myself | User: Yeah that's more of what I'm looking for!

What is a good movie that you have recently watched? | User: It can be new or older. | User: I just watched Larry Crowne (2011) and loved that one. | Recommender: Black Panther (2018) is a good popular one that's recent. I really enjoyed a lot. It is your typical action film though. | User: I haven't seen that one yet. I heard it is really good but a little darker than the other marvel movies. Would you agree with that? | Recommender: It was dark at parts, but mostly pretty light hearted. Lots of action and the characters are a little more interesting and unique than the typical Marvel films! | Recommender: Dear John  (2010) is a quite excellent drama I just watched, really got the tear ducts working. | User: I haven't seen that one. Who is in it? What kind of movie is it? | Recommender: It's a romance drama with Channing Tatum and Amanda Seyfried. Great film! | Recommender: Another one I just saw was Mad Max: Fury Road (2015) . It is kind of a three hour long chase scene, which in theory might sound dumb, but it is actually pretty cool. | User: I know of it but haven't seen it yet. I'll have to watch that one. I like romance dramas. | User: I have seen that one. It's pretty good.
