Looks like I'm watching Lincoln  (2012) | User: Thanks for all your suggestions! | Recommender: No problem!  Enjoy the films.  :) | User: I'll be watching them this weekend. | Recommender: Take care!\nRecommender: Hi. | User: Hey! Hope your day is well. Do you happen to know any good movies like This Is the End (2013) | Recommender: Is that the one with Simon Pegg, Nick Frost, and Martin Freeman? | Recommender: The bar is called &quot;The End&quot;? | User: That film or even Shutter Island  (2010) with Dicaprio was amazing | User: Nope that was with Seth Rogan and James Franco | Recommender: OH!  That one. | User: They were also in The Interview (2014) | Recommender: Gotcha.  :) | User: Have you seen that one about North Korea? | Recommender: Okay then, if you want another apocalyptic comedy (less gorey and more of a happy ending), there's Seeking a Friend for the End of the World (2012) . | User: Ive never heard of that movie actually | User: I think i may end up watching Seeking a Friend for the End of the World (2012) | User: Thank you so much for your recommendations today. | Recommender: It's Keira Knighly and Steve Carrell spending the last few days before earth is destroyed looking for a way for her to get home. | User: Oh wow I love Carrell's work in everything he does. Thank you!\nRecommender: Hi. | User: Hello! | User: I just saw Mad Max: Fury Road (2015) and was looking for a similar fun, action movie. | Recommender: Hmm...that's a tough one, but I might be able to help you. | Recommender: Have you gone back to the series roots with Mad Max (1979) ? | Recommender: My favorite is Mad Max 2 (1981) , but Mad Max Beyond Thunderdome (1985) isn't bad either. | User: I've seen all of them except Mad Max 2 (1981), which I've heard is the best of the original trilogy. | Recommender: I loved it.  :) | User: Any fun modern movies that you can think of? | Recommender: How do you feel about superhero movies?  I really enjoyed Thor: Ragnarok (2017) .  The soundtrack is a throwback to 1980s Sci-Fi and the comedy perfectly peppers a fun action film.  Plus, Jeff Goldblum. | User: Oh that actually sounds perfect. I'm trying to catch up on all the Marvel stuff. I'll be going with that tonight. Thanks for the recommendation! | Recommender: No problem.  Enjoy! | Recommender: Have a great night!\nRecommender: Hello | Recommender: Have you seen any good movies lately? | User: Hi there! | User: Well I just saw Requiem for a Dream (2000) and am looking for something a bit more happy. | User: Just anything cheerful. | Recommender: I've never seen that one. | User: It's depressing | Recommender: I watched Cars 3  (2017) recently. | Recommender: That was pretty cheerful. | User: I haven't seen the first two. I do enjoy Pixar movies though. Toy Story 3 (2010) was fantastic. | User: But yeah, just wanna watch something happy. | Recommender: Since you like Toy Story 3 (2010) you should also try The Secret Life of Pets (2016) | Recommender: It's very funny. | User: Oh that's perfect. Been wanting to watch that but forgot about it. | User: Will check that one out today. Thanks for the recommendation! | Recommender: Another one that I like is The Aristocats | User: That's a classic. | Recommender: I've liked that one since I was a kid and it still makes me laugh! | User: Awesome. Think I'll be going with The Secret Life of Pets (2016) for now. Thanks. :) | Recommender: You're welcome | User: Have a good day. | Recommender: One more came to mind, if you're into cartoon super hero type movies check out The Incredibles (2004) | Recommender: Have a great night | User: Seen that. Good movie. | User: Take care.\nRecommender: Hi. | User: Hello. | User: What good movies have you seen lately? | Recommender: As far as recent movies, I enjoyed Thor: Ragnarok (2017) a lot more than I thought I would. | Recommender: It's got a soundtrack reminiscent of 80s Sci-Fi films and the comedy is perfectly spread out through the film.  Also, it's got Jeff Goldblum doing what he does best. | User: I haven't seen any of the thors | Recommender: I think it's the best of the bunch.  The only prerequisite viewing (if any) would be the second Thor, I think. | User: I'm a big fan or movies like Forrest Gump (1994)  and Billy Madison (1995) | Recommender: I also recently saw All's Faire in Love (2009).  It's Christina Ricci in a comedy set at a Rennaissance Faire.  The jokes are kind of raunchy, but I still enjoyed it. | User: That sounds interesting. | User: I saw Dunkirk  (2017)\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant",
