I haven't seen the 2nd one yet. | User: I'm not sure if I have or not.  That sounds like The Sixth Sense (1999) once you've seen it the twist is gone. | User: Annabelle  (2014) is a good one for sure. | Recommender: Yes, exactly!  But, watch it if you haven't seen it. | Recommender: I hope this helps you? | User: Well sounds good I will look these movies up thank you. | User: Good bye. | Recommender: Thank you!  I hope you have a good night. | Recommender: Good bye.\nRecommender: Hello!  How are you? | User: Hello. I'm great, How are you? | Recommender: I'm doing well, thanks!  What kind of movies are you into? | User: I like everything.  You have any good action super hero movies? | Recommender: Sure!  I really loved Guardians of the Galaxy  (2014) , and the sequel, Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2 (2017) | User: I haven't watched either of those yet. | Recommender: The Dark Knight  (2008) never disappoints either. | User: I am going to have to check them out for sure. | User: Oh i just watched that one yesterday. | User: I love Batman. | Recommender: My favorite superhero movie of all time is Superman  (1978) .  So sad that Margot Kidder died recently. | User: That is so sad.  It's been years since I've watched that one. | Recommender: I've been wanting to watch it again after I heard of her death.  I think I liked Superman II (1980)  even better, though. | User: I will have to watch them both.  It has been so long. | User: Well thank you. | Recommender: Finally, I would suggest Spider-Man: Homecoming (2017) .  It's the last thing I saw in a movie theater of late and it's so good. | Recommender: I hope I have helped you out. | User: Oh yes I will have to look into that one as well. | User: for sure. Thank you. | User: good bye. | Recommender: I hope you enjoy your movie! | Recommender: Good bye!\nUser: Hello, how are you? | Recommender: Hello!  How are you? | Recommender: I'm doing well.

I was just thinking of one I haven't watched in forever, Love Stinks  (1999) , have you seen this one? | Recommender: No, I don't think I've seen that one. | User: It is hilarious you will have to check it out. | Recommender: If you like that type of movie, you might like I Love You to Death (1990) . | User: I've never even heard of it.  I'm going to have to look it up. | Recommender: Actually, I Love You to Death (1990)  is a comedy based on a true crime case.  Kinda crazy. | User: Oh that sounds very interesting.  That's like True Romance (1993) was based on an actual couple. | Recommender: How about Bridget Jones's Diary  (2001) ?  That's a funny comedy with a warped kind of love interest. | Recommender: I have to look up True Romance (1993) .  It sounds interesting. | User: I have seen it, but it has been a very long time since I have watched it. | User: True Romance (1993) is great.  I highly recommend that movie. | Recommender: Cool.  I will look at that.  Wristcutters: A Love Story (2006) is a crazy kind of love story as well. | Recommender: I hope I have helped you out? | User: I have heard of that one.  Oh yes you helped.  Thank you. Good Bye. | Recommender: Good bye.\nRecommender: Hello, how are you? | User: Good!

No fighting in the War Room!! | Recommender: Or one that I always thought was a great movie American Psycho  (2000) . | User: I've heard of it, but have never watched it. I will have to check it out. | User: any others? | Recommender: For sure it is a really good movie | Recommender: gets in your head. | Recommender: I will always suggest Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas  (1998) . | Recommender: I've seen the movie and read the book, for sure a great one. | User: Oh, that's a good reocmmendation.
