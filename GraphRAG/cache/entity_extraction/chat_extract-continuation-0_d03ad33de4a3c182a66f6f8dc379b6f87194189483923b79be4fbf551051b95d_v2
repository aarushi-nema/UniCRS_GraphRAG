But I also really liked Frozen (2013). The music is phenomenal. | User: Oh yes I saw Idina in the musical Wicked which was cool. She was also in the movie and broadway version of Rent  (2005) . | Recommender: And for a good live action watch Pete's Dragon  (2016), it's a remake of the animated version from the 70's. Though I liked the original a little better. So what do you think so far? | User: I have a lot of good options. I will have to check out the Pete's Dragon  (2016). I love remakes. | User: Thanks and goodbye.\nRecommender: Hello | Recommender: What kind of movie are you looking for? | User: Hi there!
