Take care! | User: you too! | User: good night\nUser: Hello. Have you seen any good movies recently? | Recommender: Yes. I recently watched The Shape of Water  (2017) Does that sound like something you would enjoy? | User: I've heard great things about it. It's up for some awards. | Recommender: Yes it is. I was excited since normally I don't care much for the movies they nominate. Another good one I've seen recently is The Big Sick (2017) but it is more of a comedy. | User: I think comedy is great too! I'm excited for Black Panther (2018) myself | Recommender: Me too! I catch all of the Avengers movies. The last one we saw was Thor: Ragnarok (2017) at the cinema. | User: I fell in love with Marvel movies when I first saw Iron Man  (2008) | Recommender: That was my introduction to the films as well. I was hooked. Do you watch X-Men  (2000)  too? | User: Yes I thought X-Men  (2000) was great. Logan  (2017) was a real peak for the series. | User: Yes I thought X-Men  (2000) was great. Logan  (2017) was a real peak for the series. | Recommender: I haven't seen that one yet. I have it and I'm saving it for a special occasion. It is nice talking to another Marvel fan. | Recommender: X-Men Origins: Wolverine (2009) was great too. I'm not sure why Logan gets all of the individual movies but I can live with that. | User: Oh man if you haven't seen it I suggest you do it soon. It is amazing. | Recommender: I will. I'm looking forward to it. | User: What did you think of Guardians of the Galaxy  (2014) ? | Recommender: I liked it, although it was a little confusing. I am paying more attention though since they are going to combine with the Avengers in Production of Avengers: Infinity War and the untitled Avengers sequel | User: After seeing Doctor Strange  (2016) I'm really excited for Production of Avengers: Infinity War and the untitled Avengers sequel | Recommender: I am too. The only aspect that is a negative to the anticipation is that it will be a two part movie. That's good because I can look forward to the next one but I'm sure I'll want to see it immediately after the first part. | Recommender: It was great talking to you. I hope you enjoy the upcoming movies, although there isn't much doubt they will be great.\nRecommender: Hello. | User: Hello, have you seen any good movies recently? | Recommender: Yes. | User: Do you have any suggestions?
