I haven't seen that one, so I will look for it! | User: I've seen Sweet Home Alabama  (2002) and loved it! | Recommender: She did an awesome job in that movie.

I was just helping a friend look through some movies.  There are some reallly awesome one's out there. | User: I'm looking for a mindbinder action kind of movie.  Something like The Matrix (1999) or Inception (2010). | User: Do you have any you could suggest? | Recommender: Oh of course.  What about one of the Matrix sequels like The Matrix Reloaded (2003) | User: That might work, because I actually haven't seen that one. | Recommender: Or another high action film is Man on Fire  (2004) | User: I haven't heard of that one.  I'll have to look for it! | Recommender: Both are high action and star very good actors.  They're not new releases but they are very good. | Recommender: Okay great.

Love Keanu Reeves. | User: I have seen those movies actually. I love the comic based movies. | Recommender: Keanu Reeves is great!  Have you seen Speed  (1994)?  I also love him in A Walk in the Clouds (1995). | User: Speed  (1994) was great. I haven't watched the other movie you mentioned but I will now. | Recommender: It's a romance set around World War II.  He plays a traumatized former soldier who falls in love when it's least convenient. | User: That sounds like a great story in any circumstances so with Keanu Reeves as well it should be really good. | User: Thanks for the suggestions. | Recommender: You're welcome. | Recommender: Have a great night! | User: You too!\nUser: Hi | Recommender: Hi! | Recommender: Are you looking for a particular genre of movie tonight? | User: Well I like kind of sappy movies.

Have you had a chance to see Love Actually (2003) It doesn't have the sci fi to it but it is good. | User: Yes, I have seen that one.  I agree that it's good! | Recommender: A sci fi one with a bit of romance I would recommend would be the new Star Trek Beyond (2016) They are doing an awesome job with these new ones. | User: Great, I haven't seen that one!
