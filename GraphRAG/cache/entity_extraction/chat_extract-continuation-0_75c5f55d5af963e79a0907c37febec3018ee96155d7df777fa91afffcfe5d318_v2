I may check it out. I'm not a huge fan of Ghostbusters (1984) the original so I may actually like the remake lol | User: Oh that's a good suggestion. I was a kid when that came out so was too young to see it | User: I'll have to check it out | Recommender: Yeah, it's a much different style of comedy than the original so it might just be your thing! | Recommender: Definitely check it out. That and DodgeBall: A True Underdog Story (2004) are my two favorite comedies. | User: Thanks a lot bud! I'll probably watch Dumb and Dumber (1994) tonight! Thanks for bringing that up!
