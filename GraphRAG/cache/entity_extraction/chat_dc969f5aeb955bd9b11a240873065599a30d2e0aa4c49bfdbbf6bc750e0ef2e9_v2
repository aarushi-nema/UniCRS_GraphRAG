I haven't heard of them | Recommender: The big one I can think of is Kill Bill: Volume 1 (2003) with Uma Thurman. She was GREAT in that movie | User: Oh yeah, I have seen that, and Kill Bill: Volume 2 (2004)  they're pretty good, I liked them but I wouldn't rewatch them. | Recommender: This one makes me cry but I LOVE Sandra Bullock - The Blind Side  (2009) . I always watch it when its on freeform | User: Oh, she's adorable. I'll check it out. Thanks for you help. | User: Have a great night! | Recommender: you too! good bye\nRecommender: Hi, how can I help? | User: Hi, I am looking for a movie to watch tonight with my boyfriend. | User: We are having a date night, haha. | Recommender: The Big Sick (2017)! | User: I haven't seen that, who stars in that? | Recommender: Kumail Nanjiani and Zoe Kazan | User: Oh, right. Is it sad like 50/50 (2011)? | User: I saw that and cried so much. It's good though. | Recommender: Melachlonic but not totally sad. | User: Oh, so it has a happy ending? | Recommender: If you liked 50/50 (2011) you'll like The Big Sick (2017). | Recommender: Yes. | Recommender: There's also Love Actually (2003). | User: Oh yeah, I have seen that, but I am not a huge fan of it. | User: But The Big Sick (2017) sounds great. | Recommender: Notting Hill ? | User: I think your first suggestion might have been the best. Weird how we just vibed like that. | User: Thanks for your help! | User: Have a great night. | Recommender: That's good. | Recommender: Can I also recommend Four Weddings and a Funeral (1994)?\nRecommender: What kind of movies do you like? | User: Hi | User: I'm looking for some good newer movies | User: Any kind really | Recommender: Have you seen Get Out (2017)? | Recommender: Or It  (2017)? | User: The Zookeeper's Wife  (2017)  was excellent | User: No I haven't seen that one yet | Recommender: Did you see Lady Bird  (2017)? | User: I want to see it.

I like horror ones. | Recommender: Hi, I would recommend a recent horror film like It  (2017). Great movie all around. | User: Thanks but I have already watched it. Could you provide me with other options? | Recommender: Well this isn't exactly a horror movie, but \n I would say Annihilation  (2018). I don't want to give away too much but there are some horror elements within the movie and there's one scene in particular that rivals most horror movies | User: In order to help you out let me narrow it for you. I like horror films which are also: fast paced, a little bit of suspense scenes, jumpscares. | User: Well I like the title of that one. I'll add it to my watch list, thank you. | Recommender: A classical one is The Shining  (1980). Also, a Stephen King novel movie. | User: That's one of my favorites, that's the kind of movies I like! | Recommender: I would even throw out there a movie like the Scary Movie (2000) series just cause it's nice to have a parody on the horror series. Even something like Game Night (2018) plays on that too, despite being mostly a comedy | User: Have you ever watched Insidious  serie? That's the kind of a horror movies I like too, fast paced with little times of suspense but gets you back to the jumpscares. | Recommender: Well to be honest I don't really like horror movies that much, not my favorite genre so I don't really watch a lot of them.
