Enjoy your movie! | User: Bye. | Recommender: bye!\nRecommender: Hi how are you? | User: I'm doing great. | User: How about you? | Recommender: Pretty good thanks. | Recommender: What are your favorite genres of movies? | User: Can you help me find a good sports movie to watch? | Recommender: The sports movies I've seen and could recommend are probably older ones like Remember the Titans (2000) Have you seen that one? | User: I have seen it. I enjoyed it. | Recommender: I know a lot of older movies and think Hollywood has gone a little bit downhill. | User: I'm fine with older movies like The Mighty Ducks (1992) | Recommender: Yes I think everyone's seen that and it's pretty fun :) | Recommender: The Natural  (1984) is a classic and it's one of those deeper movies. | User: I have never heard of it. | User: What is it about? | Recommender: Also Brian's Song was really good and also deep. | User: I'm not really looking for deep. | Recommender: It's about a baseball player going through life changes while trying to make it big. FIrst movie I saw with Robert Redford | Recommender: How about something like The Waterboy (1998) it's probably one of the most hilarious movies I've seen | User: Maybe. | Recommender: Or again if we're going for older films Caddyshack (1980) might qualify as sports, also golf. | User: Well, you've given me some things to think about. | User: Thanks for your suggestions. | Recommender: No problem, I hope you enjoy them if you decide to watch!\nRecommender: Hi | User: Hey! | User: Looking for a comedy movie, but nothing raunchy like Sausage Party | Recommender: Have you seen Amélie (2001) ? | User: Yes!

I watched that one in college and loved it. I need to re-watch it though. | Recommender: Seems like the more recent comedies are all raunchy | User: That's true.

Never heard of it. | Recommender: Or Being There (1979) ? | User: Never heard of that one either. | Recommender: They are witty comedies | User: Okay, I'll check those out.

Love an underdog story. | Recommender: well, there is the classic kids movie, Space Jam (1996) or there is movies like Moneyball  (2011) ? | User: Space Jam (1996) might be a bit too childish for me. Moneyball  (2011) sounds good though! | Recommender: Have you ever seen Radio  (2003) I love that one! | User: I have not. That does seem like a good feel good movie. I will try that tonight! | Recommender: Little Giants (1994) is another good one! | Recommender: Yes, Radio  (2003) will be something I believe you will enjoy a lot. | User: Yeah, then maybe I will check Little Giants out.
