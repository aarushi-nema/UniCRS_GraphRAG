I'm so use to watching movies like Deadpool  (2016) and Ferris Bueller's Day Off (1986) the recommendations you selected are great! Thanks! | User: Yes Kevin is hilarious! Have a great day and thanks so much for your help!\nRecommender: Hey, how are you today? | User: Hello. I'm doing well. Yourself? | User: Have you seen anything interesting recently? | Recommender: I have.  I just watched Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2 (2017) ! | User: I haven't seen that yet. I did watch Guardians of the Galaxy  (2014)  though. I have to catch up with the sequel | Recommender: Did you enjoy it?  That is to say do you like superhero movies like that? | User: Yes. They are my favorite genre. I think my all time favorite is still the original The Avengers  (2012) | Recommender: Yes!  That is a good one.  I have recently loved Wonder Woman  (2017) !  I thought Gal Gadot did an excellent job. | User: She did. I was very impressed with that movie and with her as a person honestly. She was perfect for the role. | Recommender: Indeed.  She was the only good thing about Justice League  (2017) !! | User: I agree. That movie was not great. I didn't like any of the Fantastic Four  (2015) movies or remakes either. | User: Thanks a lot for your help. I've got some good options in mind now. | Recommender: No problem!\nRecommender: Hello. How is your day going? | Recommender: Is there anything specific your looking for? | User: Hello!  I am looking for a good documentary!  Something like Blackfish  (2013) ! | User: I saw that movie and liked it although it was very sad. | Recommender: Yes it was. I'm thinking of a title. One second. I saw a documentary very similar and I have to think of the title. | Recommender: I got it. The Cove  (2009) | Recommender: I will warn you though I could only watch half. It upset me too much to finish. | User: Was that the one about the dolphins?  I watched that too and it made me very sad. | User: Perhaps I should watch a happier documentary? | Recommender: Yes. That's the one. | Recommender: To get a break from animal cruelty The Square  (2017)  is a good documentary about the revolution in Egypt. | User: I have never seen that!  I will have to look it up. | Recommender: Food, Inc. (2008) is interesting as well. I enjoyed it because it was very informative. | User: Thank you for the excellent suggestions!!\nRecommender: Hi there!  How can I help you? | User: Hello. I hope you are having a good day. | User: Have you seen anything that really caught your interest lately? | Recommender: I have.  The new star wars movie Star Wars: Episode VIII – The Last Jedi (2017)  was really good!!  Have you seen it? | User: Yes I have. I really liked it. I have Rogue One: A Star Wars Story (2016) but I'm saving it to watch on a special occasion. | Recommender: That was also a good one.  I am very excited about the upcoming Solo movie. | User: Me too. I wish Carrie Fisher had not passed away though. That was very sad. I will always remember her performance in The Empire Strikes Back (1980) | Recommender: She was amazing.  She was good in Star Wars: The Force Awakens (2015) !! | User: Yes she was. My husband and I were like children when we went to see that movie. We were so excited. | User: Thank you for the suggestions. I will go back and re-watch some of my Star Wars films now. | User: Have a good day. | Recommender: you too!  good bye!~\nRecommender: What kind of movies are you looking for today? | User: Hey I'm looking for movie recommendations for scary movies. Anything like Scream  (1996) I Know What You Did Last Summer (1997) and Scary Movie 2 (2001) thanks! | User: Also gory movies like Hellraiser (1987) are good for me as well. | Recommender: I would recommend Martyrs  (2016) if you haven't seen it.  Very gory! | Recommender: Also The Witch  (2015) was surprisingly well done. | User: Great I will definitely check out the recommendations you provided.
