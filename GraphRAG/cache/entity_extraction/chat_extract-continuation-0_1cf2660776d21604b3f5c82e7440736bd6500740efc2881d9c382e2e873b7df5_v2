The original It (1990)  was a good movie too. | Recommender: Have you seen Get Out (2017) ? | User: No. I have heard of it though. Is it good? | Recommender: Yes, it is very good.  Or there's Thor: Ragnarok (2017) which I also hear is quite good. | User: It is. It was. I caught that one in theaters. The only movies I ever watch at a theater are the Marvel movies. I haven't missed one yet. | User: I will watch the movie you suggested. Probably later this evening. Thanks for your help. | Recommender: You're welcome, have a good night.  Bye | User: Bye\nRecommender: Hello. | User: Hello!  How are you? | Recommender: I am fine. I hope your enjoying your evening as well. Are you looking for a specific genre today? | User: Yes, either scary movie or psychological thriller.  I really liked The Silence of the Lambs  (1991), I know it's a bit old but I haven't found its equal yet. | Recommender: Yes that is a unique movie that nothing else really compares to. Have you seen the other movies in that story arc such as Red Dragon  (2002) ? | Recommender: Seven  (1995)  is a good movie with a psychological aspect. | User: I liked Red Dragon  (2002) and Hannibal  (2001) both.  I haven't seen Seven  (1995) yet, that sounds intriguing. | User: Do you know of any other good ones? | Recommender: I really enjoyed it. I don't know if The Hateful Eight (2015)  belongs completely in these categories but it was an awesome movie. | Recommender: Kiss the Girls  (1997)  is a good one based on a novel. | User: OK, that sounds good also.  I will check those out.  Thank you for the ideas! | Recommender: You're welcome. Have a good night | User: You as well.  Bye.\nUser: Hello. | Recommender: Hello. What sort of movies do you prefer? Is there anything you've watched recently you really enjoyed? | User: I'd like a good movie thats a comedy.  I havne't seen any really good movies lately.  I watched 12 Years a Slave  (2013)  the other day and I love history | Recommender: Have you seen Father Figures (2017) ? It is very new. | User: I havent . | User: The Help  (2011) was a funny and great movie. | Recommender: The Secret Life of Bees  (2008)  is a comedy with a serious theme, sort of similar to The Help  (2011) | User: Thanks .  I'll have to check it out.   Whos in it? | Recommender: Paul Bettany and Tim Burton's wife, that I can't think of the name of right now. | User: Nice thanks for the suggestions.  Have a great night! | Recommender: You too. Good night.\nRecommender: Hello, how are you? | User: Good evening. | User: I'm awesome.  I am looking for a new movie to watch. | Recommender: What kind of movies do you like to watch? | User: I like sweet movies that have a little love and humor in them. | Recommender: Like love stories for example? | User: I seen 50 First Dates (2004) and Pretty Woman (1990) last week | User: Yes.  Mostly like that.  But with a little comedy thrown in. | User: Hello?  Can you help me find one? | Recommender: The Bad Batch (2016) sounds like it might work for you. | Recommender: Then there's How to Talk to Girls at Parties  | Recommender: or The Big Sick (2017). | User: I seen Bad Batch but I haven't seen the other two. | Recommender: Did you like it? | User: Those should work.  Yes I am going to look and see if I can find them. | User: Thank you.  Goodbye | Recommender: Home Again (2017)  is a romantic comedy | Recommender: You're welcome | User: Okay. I will look for Home Again also | Recommender: Yes, it has Reese Witherspoon so it's got to be good.\nUser: Hello. How is your night going? | Recommender: Hi.  It's going great in Kentucky.  How is your evening? | Recommender: I'm here to help you find a movie or two. If that is what you would like. | User: I'm trying to find some movies I'm not familiar with. My movie interested have sort of turned into tunnel vision with Marvel and Star Wars. Absolutely another movie outside of those story arcs is perfect. | User: For example I watched Thor: Ragnarok (2017)  and Rogue One: A Star Wars Story (2016)  recently and that is really it for movies that I've seen in the last few months. | Recommender: LOL, yes there are so many Sci Fi's out there.  I can help you find a comedy or a horror.  Will either of those work for you? | User: Yes. I love horror movies. | Recommender: For example Mother! (2017) was really good.  It was a bit chilling but it left me on the edge of my seat wondering what was going to happen. | User: Is that the movie where\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>IT (1990)<|>MOVIE<|>A good movie)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>GET OUT (2017)<|>MOVIE<|>A very good movie)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>THOR: RAGNAROK (2017)<|>MOVIE<|>A quite good movie)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>MARVEL<|>GENRE<|>Marvel movies)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>THE SILENCE OF THE LAMBS (1991)<|>MOVIE<|>A unique movie)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>RED DRAGON (2002)<|>MOVIE<|>A good movie)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>HANNIBAL (2001)<|>MOVIE<|>A good movie)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SEVEN (1995)<|>MOVIE<|>A good movie with a psychological aspect)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>THE HATEFUL EIGHT (2015)<|>MOVIE<|>An awesome movie)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>KISS THE GIRLS (1997)<|>MOVIE<|>A good movie based on a novel)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>COMEDY<|>GENRE<|>Comedy movies)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>12 YEARS A SLAVE (2013)<|>MOVIE<|>A movie about history)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>FATHER FIGURES (2017)<|>MOVIE<|>A very new movie)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>THE HELP (2011)<|>MOVIE<|>A funny and great movie)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>THE SECRET LIFE OF BEES (2008)<|>MOVIE<|>A comedy with a serious theme)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>PAUL BETTANY<|>ACTOR<|>Actor in The Secret Life of Bees)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>TIM BURTON<|>DIRECTOR<|>Director of The Secret Life of Bees)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>LOVE STORIES<|>GENRE<|>Love stories)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>50 FIRST DATES (2004)<|>MOVIE<|>A movie)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>PRETTY WOMAN (1990)<|>MOVIE<|>A movie)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>THE BAD BATCH (2016)<|>MOVIE<|>A movie)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>HOW TO TALK TO GIRLS AT PARTIES<|>MOVIE<|>A movie)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>THE BIG SICK (2017)<|>MOVIE<|>A movie)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>THE BAD BATCH<|>MOVIE<|>A movie)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>HOME AGAIN (2017)<|>MOVIE<|>A romantic comedy)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>REESE WITHERSPOON<|>ACTOR<|>Actor in Home Again)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>MOTHER!
