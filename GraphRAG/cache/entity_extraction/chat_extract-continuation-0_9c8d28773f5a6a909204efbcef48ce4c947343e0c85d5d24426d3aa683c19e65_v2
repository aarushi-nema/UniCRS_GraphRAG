Hit me. | User: I was looking for something like Blended  (2014) ind | User: Something with Adam Sandler | Recommender: I am a huge fan of The Longest Yard  (2005) , the remake | Recommender: it's not even a guilty pleasure, it's a damn good movie | User: I don't think I've seen that one yet | Recommender: it's good. Similar humor to Happy Gilmore (1996) and an underdog story, but I'd argue a little more heartwarming and less slapstick | User: Ohhh I love that movie! | User: I just recently watched The Cobbler  (2014) as well | User: Thought that was a sweet movie. | Recommender: I heard very mixed things about that one. I haven't cared too much for Adam Sandler past Click  (2006) , and even then that movie was just too sad for rewatching lol | User: Oh that one was a huge favorite of mine! Anyways, thank you for the chat! :) | Recommender: thank you too, have a great day :)\nRecommender: Hello | Recommender: What types of movies do you like? | User: hello! | User: I love some comedy. I recently rewatched Spy Hard (1996) and want to see something similar | Recommender: You might like 2001: A Space Travesty (2000) | Recommender: It's comedic gold I think lol | User: I've never heard of that, is it like Spaceballs (1987) ? | Recommender: A lot, actually. | Recommender: Also one of my favorites. lol | Recommender: Epic Movie (2007) was pretty funny too, Snoop was in it | User: I'll check it out! Spaceballs is a firm favorite of mine, Mel Brooks is just great. Blazing Saddles (1974) is one of my all-time faves | Recommender: I don't recall ever seeing that? | Recommender: But they are making a sequel to Spaceballs (1987) . Pretty excited about that! | User: I didn't care for Epic Movie too much... I felt like the movies outside of the Scary Movie  series were a bit off | Recommender: Well hopefully you've had a good chat. Have a good day! :) | User: well hey, thanks for the recommendation, I'll check it out. Have a fantastic day!\nUser: Hi | Recommender: Hello! What kind of movie are you looking for? | User: Probably a good romance | Recommender: ooh, I'll be completely honest, I'm not a great expert on romantic movies. I like 10 Things I Hate About You (1999) | User: That's a classic favorite of mine! Anything with that lead actor | Recommender: and There's Something About Mary (1998) ... I guess romcoms are fun for me | User: I really liked that one. | Recommender: Heath Ledger? Yeah, he was so good. Made A Knight's Tale (2001) . | User: He was good no matter what he did. :( | User: there was one old western with him in it. | User: I can't recall the name Grrr lol | User: but he was wonderful in Batman  | Recommender: Brokeback Mountain (2005) was one which I disliked... one of the earlier representations of a gay relationship and they made the whole thing about sex instead of love. Anne Hathaway is amazing though | User: I honestly have not seen that one, been debating but just hasn't gotten to it yet. | Recommender: Yes! Dark Knight was awesome! Saw that on release day | User: Well, I hope you have a good day. Thanks for the suggestions!\nRecommender: Hey! | User: Hello! | Recommender: Would you like to hear about some really good movies? | User: I'm looking for a fun animation, something like WALL-E (2008) | Recommender: Something along the lines of Changing Lanes (2002) | Recommender: Oh thats a fantastic film as well. Nominated for a few Oscars | User: I have never seen that, what's it like? | Recommender: Ok. Have you seen Zootopia opia yet. Its an animated adventure with a bunny | User: I loved Zootopia. Sing  (2016)  is a bit of a guilty pleasure too, I normally dislike that studio | Recommender: Changing Lanes (2002) was about a lawyer getting into an accident with a someone greedy for money | Recommender: Wonderful movie Sing  (2016) Ive seen that many times haha | Recommender: Lastly i highly recommend Thor: Ragnarok (2017) it some animation actually | User: my daughter likes anything musical.
