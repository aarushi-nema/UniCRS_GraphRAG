Have you seen that | User: I really wanted something in the theaters this weekend. | Recommender: Have you thought about Black Panther (2018) ? | User: Do you know the rating for that? | User: I want something all parents involved will be okay with. | Recommender: Hmm I do not, what about A Wrinkle in Time  ?
