It might have been a mini series but it's only like three hours long and it scared the crap out of me | Recommender: What's your favorite non-Stephen King horror movie? | User: I remember that one. They were on the plane. | User: Child's Play. because it's hilarious now. I watch it almost daily. | User: Child's Play  (1988) . because it's hilarious now. I watch it almost daily. | Recommender: Haha that' is a funny movie. I like how absurd some of the sequels are like Bride of Chucky (1998) . Anyways, good talking to you. Goodbye!\nUser: Hello. | Recommender: Hey how is it going, what kind of movie are you looking to watch? | User: Can you suggest some good horror movies , past or present? | Recommender: Well if you're looking for recent I liked Get Out (2017) , it was cool to see a horror movie that also had a political statement to it. I also really like the remake of It  (2017) | User: Those are both great. I saw them. | Recommender: If you want to talk older movies I really like the early zombie movies like Night of the Living Dead (1968) and The Serpent and the Rainbow  (1988) | User: Oh I want to see the Serpent and the Rainbow. I forgot about it. Thank you. | Recommender: It's good and actual deals with supposed &quot;real life&quot; zombies not just hollywood versions of them | User: Yes. Thanks again. Goodbye.\nRecommender: what types of movies would you like me to recommend tonight? | Recommender: hello? | User: Hi sorry. Um maybe a good movie about the paranormal | Recommender: ooh okay good pick! | Recommender: Annabelle  (2014) | User: Hmm I haven't seen that. What's it about? | Recommender: or The Amityville Horror  (1979) is always a go to classic | Recommender: a doll that apparently has paranormal powers | Recommender: i kept my light on at night for like a week after seeing it ha | User: Oh many dolls scare the crap out of me. Even though it's super cheesey Child's Play  (1988) traumatized me as a kid. | Recommender: Bride of Chucky (1998) terrified me too | Recommender: stupid dolls! | User: Haha well at least by that time I was a little more grown up. What kind of movies do you like?&gt; | Recommender: documentaries! | User: I just watched Man on Wire (2008) last night. So good. | Recommender: never seen it! | User: It's a must watch.

Two of my favorite older comedies are Blazing Saddles (1974) and Airplane! (1980) | User: Oh awesome I will check them out! What are they like? | Recommender: Blazing Saddles is about a black sherrif coming to an old west town, it's a dark comedy by Mel Brooks who also directed movies like Spaceballs (1987) and Young Frankenstein (1974). Airplane! is just that, about an airplane, it's an over the top slapstick comedy that was ahead of its time. | Recommender: Have you seen any Mel Brooks movies? He's considered the godfather of comedy. | User: I have seen Spaceballs (1987) ! One of my very favorites, actually but never delved into his other work. | Recommender: You should! He's hilarious, and makes cameos in all of his movies. | User: I will have to see Young Frankenstein (1974) too, sounds like I have a lot to catch up on. | User: Thank you so much for the suggestions, I will watch them all! | Recommender: Sounds good goodbye! | User: Bye!\nUser: Hello! | Recommender: good morning | User: Do you know some good action movies? | User: Like Black Panther (2018) or Fast & Furious  (2009) | Recommender: Well let me think a second. | User: Sure thing! | Recommender: Rampage  (2009) | User: Superheros, sci fi, etc..doesn't matter!
