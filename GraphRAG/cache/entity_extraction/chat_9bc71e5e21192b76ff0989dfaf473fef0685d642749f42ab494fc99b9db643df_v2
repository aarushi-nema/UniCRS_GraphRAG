I was curious as to if that was good. Have you seen? Is it worth a watch? | Recommender: its hillarious. i love it, id watch it again, | User: Definitely going to have to check it out. Thanks so much | User: Have a great rest of the day, and Super Bowl weekend! | Recommender: np! thanks for talking to me\nUser: hey. how are ya | Recommender: Hello. I am doing well. Yourself? | Recommender: Is there anything specific you are looking for? | User: not bad at all. see any good movies lately? | User: I'm up for any genre | Recommender: The last movie I watched that I really enjoyed was Suicide Squad  (2016) although I was a little late to the game with that. | Recommender: I was surprised at how much I liked it. I also watched Dunkirk  (2017)  recently and enjoyed it as well. | User: Ah! I may check it out. I've been hestitant with DC movies since I didn't like Man of Steel  (2013) that much | Recommender: Exactly. I didn't watch it because I was not a fan of other DC movies. I'm much more of a marvel fan. The Avengers  (2012) is still one of my favorities. | User: Dunkirk  (2017) k was great. Reminds me of Saving Private Ryan (1998) | User: I've seen all of the marvel movies minus Ant-Man  (2015). Would you recommend? | Recommender: That wasn't one of the best, in my opinion. I think you should watch anyway though so you don't miss any pieces of the story. I watched Guardians of the Galaxy  (2014) recently in preparation for their merge with the Avengers as well. | User: I can't wait until the next film! Thanks so much for the Suicide Squad  (2016) suggestion. I may finally give it a shot | User: It was nice talking to you bud! Have a great superbowl weekend! | Recommender: You're welcome. The Joker in that movie was awesome. I hope you enjoy it.\nUser: hey there | Recommender: Hi there. Have you seen The Wonder  (2016) ? | User: Not yet. what genre is it | Recommender: I think it is a drama. I heard it was good. What kind of movies do you like? | User: I'll watch anything really. My favorites are comedies though. I love Anchorman 2: The Legend Continues (2013) | Recommender: That was funny. Do you like Adam Sandler? What about The Waterboy (1998) ? | User: If it's a drama I'll probably like The Wonder  (2016). Another one of my favorites Good Will Hunting (1997) is also a drama | Recommender: I also liked How to Lose a Guy in 10 Days (2003) | User: Yes I love the older Sandler flicks. He's lacking lately but Billy Madison (1995) and Big Daddy  (1999) are some of my favorites | Recommender: I loved Good Will Hunting (1997) ! Those were good. | Recommender: Another good comedy is The Big Sick (2017) | User: Ah, never seen How to Lose a Guy in 10 Days (2003). I may check that and The Wonder  (2016) out tonight | Recommender: I hope you do! | User: thanks so much for your suggestions | User: thanks so much for your suggestions | User: thanks so much for your suggestions | User: thanks so much for your suggestions | User: thanks so much for your suggestions | User: thanks so much for your suggestions | Recommender: Your welcome. Have a great weekend!\nUser: Hi! Got any good movie suggestions? I like dark comedies. | Recommender: That is a good category. I'm going to have to think for a second. | User: Cool. I also like absurd Mel Brooks-esque stuff | Recommender: I watched a good British comedy called Death at a Funeral  (2010) The British are good with that genre. | User: Ooo, I should check that out | Recommender: I just remembered another one. It's called In Bruges (2008) . It stars the actor that was the lead in Sunshine  (2007) | User: I haven't seen either one of those. What's In Bruges (2008) about? | Recommender: The plot involves two men that work as basically hired help for the mafia. They are really good friends but end up pitted against one another. They use dark humor to deal with the situation but it has a tragic ending. | User: Sounds good, I'm gonna write that one down | Recommender: One of my favorite movies is Seven Psychopaths (2012) . I liked it so much I've watched it probably 6 or 7 times. | User: Awesome. I have literally written both those down, ha | User: You ever see Withnail and I (1987) ? Classic. | Recommender: Cool. I hope you like them. I like dark comedies too and it is sometimes hard to find good movies of that sort. | Recommender: I haven't. I will check it out though. | User: Oh, you should, two out of work British actors, doing everything they can to get loaded... Another good one, little known, it was on Netflix... ahhh, yeah, God Bless America  (2011). Not great art, but fun.\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}], "parameters": {"model": "gpt-3.5-turbo", "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "temperature": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0}}}
