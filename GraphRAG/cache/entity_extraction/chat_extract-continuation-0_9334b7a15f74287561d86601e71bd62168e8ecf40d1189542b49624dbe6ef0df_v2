I like all sorts of movies but my favorite movie is Labyrinth  (1986) | Recommender: okay can you help me a little and tell me what you liked best about Labyrinth  (1986) ? | User: I like the fantasy and the music. | Recommender: ooops I wrote the wrong one.  Hold on, Labyrinth  (1986) | Recommender: different spellings! | Recommender: okay so now do they have to be family friendly or can they be darker? | Recommender: I loved Pan's Labyrinth (2006) | User: Oh I didn't know there was a similar one. Darker movies are fine. | User: Yes I have seen that one. It's a good suggestion though. | Recommender: ok and then did you see, it's older a movie called Time Bandits (1981) | Recommender: entertaining but not academy award material | User: Yes I love the director. I'm so excited for his new movie coming soon. | Recommender: okay so you are a fantasy fan, so you've obviously seen the The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring (2001) | User: Haha yes I have. It is very good too. | Recommender: it wasn't a major hit, but I would suggest a movie called Willow  (1988) | Recommender: its a ron howard fantasy film | User: Sorry, I'm making this difficult. I've seen that too. Maybe I should find another genre. | Recommender: not too complex, lots of fantasy elements. | User: These are all good suggestions though. | Recommender: noooo! one more before we switch genres.... | Recommender: Kubo and the Two Strings (2016) | Recommender: it's animation which I normally don't like but this one was special | User: Oh, you're so close. I just saw it recently. | Recommender: lol | Recommender: wasn't it great? | User: Yes it was good and different. | Recommender: and the soundtrack | Recommender: ok well one last then we change genres.  I saw it on netflix or maybe amazon it was called MirrorMask (2005) | User: I saw that in the theater! I love Neil Gaiman too. | User: What's your favorite movie of a different type? | Recommender: I didn't think I'd like it. but it was a good plot without getting too complex. | Recommender: I like good movies.  not genre specific but sci fi and fantasy are not my first go tos.  Like drama. | Recommender: horror | Recommender: foreign | User: I don't like a lot of horror with gore. Scary is ok with less blood. | User: Oh let's try foreign. I've seen more French movies than others. I like Amélie (2001) . | Recommender: most horror now is bloody. | User: And I like The Double Life of Veronique (1991) . | Recommender: did you see French version of War of the Buttons  (2011) ? | User: I have not! | Recommender: oh it's good. | Recommender: takes place during WWII and follows kids and adults. | User: I will try to check it out. | Recommender: also, I think you'd like this, it's called Korkoro and involves a gypsy clan in France trying to escape being imprisoned by the Nazis | User: Ok thank you. I don't know that one either. | Recommender: sad, magical, real, very good | Recommender: very French | Recommender: ok, well sorry I couldn't help you with fantasy but glad I could help with foreign! | User: Yes, thank you! | Recommender: you were fun to talk with! | Recommender: have a nice rest of the day! | User: You too! Goodbye :-)\nRecommender: Hi. What kind of movies do you like? | User: Hi, I liked Pirates of the Caribbean . | Recommender: That's a good one. Have you seen the sequel Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest (2006) ? | User: I think so. | User: What else would you recommend? Outside of that franchise. | Recommender: Are you interested in mostly adventure moves? Iron Man  (2008)  was pretty good. | User: I like adventure movies, but i'm weird about marvel movies. Sometimes I like them, sometimes not. | Recommender: I know what you mean. I am a big fan of Ant-Man  (2015)  but was less fond of Dr. Strange  . | Recommender: How about the Transformers  (2007) franchise? | User: Ohh, I actually liked Dr. Strange  better of those two. I don't think I've seen Transformers  (2007). | Recommender: Have you watched The Hunger Games  (2012) ? | User: Yes! I did enjoy that one. | User: The books were good too. | Recommender: If you liked that one you might enjoy The Maze Runner  (2014) . | User: Yes, that one was good. Thanks. Goodbye! | Recommender: It was based on a book series too. Bye\nUser: Hi hello! | Recommender: Hello! | User: How are you? | Recommender: What kind of movies do you like? | Recommender: I'm well.
