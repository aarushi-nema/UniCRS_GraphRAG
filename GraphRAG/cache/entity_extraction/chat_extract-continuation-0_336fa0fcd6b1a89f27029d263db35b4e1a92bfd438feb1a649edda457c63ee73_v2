That's really a funny parody of spy movies. | Recommender: haha yea i liked that one | User: It was a lot of fun! Generally I don't like the sort of movie it's parodying too much. | Recommender: yeah that is true! I hope you like the different choices. ttyl\nUser: hey there | Recommender: Hi! What type of movie can I help you find tonight? | User: im interested in romance movies | Recommender: Dirty Dancing is a great option as is Bridget Jones's Diary  (2001). They both make me feel good. | User: Dirty Dancing  is one of my favorite movies ever. | Recommender: Have you seen the new version Dirty Dancing: Havana Nights? | User: I havent seen that one yet but i might add it to my list. is it as good as the original? | Recommender: Footloose  (1984) and Flashdance (1983) have some similarities as well. | Recommender: I think the original was better. But it's a pretty similar copy really. | User: Footloose  (1984) is great! | User: the remake Footloose  (2011)  wasnt too bad either | Recommender: I haven't seen that version. I've seen the Broadway play though. It was really enjoyable. | User: i have to see that some time | Recommender: With musicals I generally prefer the live versions. The movie version can never capture the full experience. | User: yea thats so true | User: thanks for the tips! later\nUser: Hi. Do you have any good Animated Movie suggestions? | Recommender: Coco  (2017)  was really good | Recommender: great graphics | User: I haven't seen that What is it about? | User: I really enjoyed Ferdinand (2017) about the bull | Recommender: Its about the Day of the dead | User: Are there any older movies that I could watch at home with my kids? | Recommender: Trolls  (2016)  was really good. and Moana  (2016)  I would love for the songs to stay out of my head lol | User: I really liked Moana  (2016) and Trolls  (2016) | User: They do have catchy music! | Recommender: I actually watched Moana  (2016)  yesterday and there was a part I have never seen | Recommender: and Ive watched each prob 100 times | User: Maybe we will catch Coco  (2017) when it comes out on DVD.

But I really haven't been too much of a fan of the Saw  (2004) series. It's just too violent and gory for me. | Recommender: true violent and gore isnt for everyone lol did you get a chance to see It  (2017) | User: I haven't seen that one either. I want to. But I'm waiting until the sequel comes out so I can watch them back to back. I usually do that with these two part moies. | Recommender: thats a good idea. I actually did that with the Twilight  (2008) movies | User: Yeah it makes the movies flow better. Even though it puts me so far behind.
