It was such a cute movie, I think you would enjoy it! | User: I wanted to see that one! | User: Thanks for reminding me | User: I hope it is an uplifting film | Recommender: No problem! It is. Echo really takes on the persona of a person. | User: Wonderful.  Just what I'm in the mood for.  Thank you so much. | Recommender: Your welcome, enjoy! | User: Have a wonderful day. | Recommender: You too, bye! | User: Goodbye\nRecommender: Hello!\\ | User: Hi! Did you know today is Emma Watson's birthday? 28 already... | User: Makes me feel old, but I loved the Harry Potter  series. | Recommender: Oh wow! that makes me feel really old! | User: Ha, jinx | Recommender: I loved Harry Potter since the movies first came out! | User: Agreed! I was 15 when they came out, I believe. Can't remember the exact year. | Recommender: I'm not sure! I'm actually trying to find another series like it! any recommendations? | User: Well, The Princess Bride  (1987) is obvious, but have you seen Stardust  (2007)? | User: Also, happily Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them  (2016) is getting a sequel, I believe. | Recommender: I loved The princess Bride! It reminds me of Robin Hood: Men in Tights (1993) | User: Ah, a classic. Mel Brooks is a national treasure. | Recommender: I haven't seen those movies! I'll have to check them out | User: Oh, most definitely. Stardust  (2007) has a great feel to it, in the same vain as The Princess Bride  (1987) in my opinion. | User: Well, I suppose I should let you go. I will hopefully see you around though! Take care! | Recommender: Thanks for the suggestion! I'll definitely check Stardust later! Have a good day!\nRecommender: Hello neighbor! | Recommender: Would you like to discuss family friendly comedies, spicy romances, or just talk favorite actors? | User: I'll go with family friendly comedies! | Recommender: Sweet! I just finished watching Groundhog Day  (1993), so I was kind of hoping for that lol | User: Oh man I love Groundhog Day  (1993) ! I also love Bill Murray in What About Bob%3F (1991) | Recommender: Got any suggestions? I will start typing ones I like too :) | Recommender: Ah, that is a good one. | Recommender: Galaxy Quest (1999) and Stripes  (1981) s also come to mind. | User: I haven't seen either of those, or even heard of them. | User: I'll have to look them up! | Recommender: Wow! I can sort of understand not knowing Galaxy Quest (1999) (Which everybody I know loves), but not having seen Stripes  (1981) is a bit surprising. | Recommender: I hope you check them both out, for joy joy feelings in a jolly good way! | User: Haha! I'll definitely have to see if I can find both of those and watch them. Night! | Recommender: Goodnight!\nUser: Hello! | Recommender: Hello there kind stranger! | User: I'm looking for some good action movies. | User: Like John Wick (2014) | Recommender: Action movies are always good. Can't beat a classic like Die Hard (1988) | Recommender: As far as modern flicks, you can always look to Liam Neison too. | User: Oh yeah, Die Hard (1988) is great. I like Liam Neison also. | User: I really liked him in Taken  (2008) | Recommender: Did you know that John Wick (2014) is actually a video game movie? It is based on the Payday game series. | User: No I had no idea! | Recommender: Yeah, that one surprises most people I tell. :) There isn't really much story in the game is why, but John Wick is the main character. | User: Interesting! Do you have any other action movie suggestions for me? | Recommender: Sure! I suppose my go-to action movie right now would have to be The Bourne Identity  (2002). Not very inspired, I know. But solid film. | Recommender: Alternatively, can't go wrong with the Predator  (1987) or Alien  (1979) series. | User: Oh yeah, I actually am not sure I've seen the entire The Bourne Identity  (2002)  movie. I'll have to watch it. I love those other movies. | User: I'll make time  to watch The Bourne Identity  (2002) . Thanks for the suggestions! | Recommender: Ip Man  if you are just looking for fighting. | Recommender: Okay! Take care! | User: Never heard of it - I'll check it out! | Recommender: Do look at that one. It is great. | User: Okay, bye!\nRecommender: Hello! | User: Hello! | Recommender: Looking for a good movie\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}], "parameters": {"model": "gpt-3.5-turbo", "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "temperature": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0}}}
