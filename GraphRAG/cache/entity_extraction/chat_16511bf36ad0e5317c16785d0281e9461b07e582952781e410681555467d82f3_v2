Have a great night! | Recommender: You too.  Good night!\nUser: Hey there | Recommender: Hi! | Recommender: What can I do for you tonight? | User: I'm looking for some funny movies! | Recommender: Something classic or contemporary?  Age-restrictions? | User: I really don't have a preference although I haven't seen a lot of the contemporary ones | User: No age restrictions | Recommender: I think I've got a few films for you... | Recommender: If you don't mind Rated-R films, Deadpool  (2016)  was fun.  It was juvenile in the sense that it felt like it was written and acted by middle schoolers high on Pixie Stiks, but it was actually a lot of fun to see. | User: Oh yeah, I actually just saw Deadpool  (2016) . My husband insisted. It was actually really funny and I'm looking forward to the next one. | Recommender: Me too.  :) | Recommender: Have you seen Thor: Ragnarok (2017) ?  Yes, another super hero film, but it's got a comedic streak a mile wide.  The soundtrack and theme act as homages to Sci-Fi films from the 1980s.  Also, Jeff Goldblum doing what Jeff Goldblum does best.  :) | User: No, I haven't even heard of it! | Recommender: It's part of the Marvel Cinematic Universe and the third Thor stand-alone film. | User: It sounds great | Recommender: I ended up enjoying it a lot more than I thought I would. | Recommender: Got one more for you.  Feel free to disagree, but here me out: Ghostbusters  (2016) .  While the characters lack the chemistry the original crew had and the overall concept falls short of living up to its source material, it's still a competent action comedy at the end of the day. | Recommender: hear me out* | Recommender: It's worth a Redbox on a lazy Sunday afternoon. | User: Yeah, I definitely had stayed away from that one because I just didn't think it could compete with the original. But I may have to give it a shot. | Recommender: It can't compete with the original and there are flaws to overlook, but it's still not bad. | Recommender: Like I said, a lazy Sunday afternoon on Redbox. | Recommender: All the same, anything else I can do for you? | User: That sounds great. Maybe I'll pair it with the original Ghostbusters (1984) just for fun. | User: Thanks for the suggestions! Have a good night! | Recommender: Good call.  :) | Recommender: Good night!\nRecommender: hey | User: Hello | User: Hello | User: I'm looking for family movies, kid-friendly | Recommender: sounds great | Recommender: have you seen The Boss Baby (2017) | User: Yes, my kids love that movie! It's pretty funny. | Recommender: Moana  (2016) is a pretty cute one too | Recommender: kids went crazy for Frozen (2013) | User: Oh yeah my kids love both of those as well, they would watch them on repeat if I would let them | Recommender: aww thats sweet | Recommender: the classics are still great like The Lion King (1994) and Aladdin  (1992) | Recommender: The Emoji Movie (2017) is a recent one that i think they would like | User: I've never seen The Emoji Movie (2017) ! But I do love those classics | User: Thanks so much for all the suggestions! | Recommender: you are welcome!\nUser: Hello how are you | User: are you familiar with sci fi films | Recommender: yes I enjoy many sci fi films | User: whats your favorites | Recommender: have you seen 2001: A Space Odyssey  (1968) | User: no but I have heard of it | User: s it about | User: is it similar Arrival  (2016) in anyway | Recommender: only similar in the sense that it is a Sci-Fi movie. Arrival  (2016) is more like Close Encounters of the Third Kind (1977) | Recommender: Did you like Arrival  (2016)? | User: yes sorry | User: about the delay | User: Arrival  (2016)  is one of my favorite movies | User: i have seen it a billion times almost as much as Hellraiser (1987) now that is a classic that many people have not seen | Recommender: I have not seen Hellraiser (1987) what is it like? | User: it is like a sci fi mixed with a horror film | User: its pretty old but it never gets old to me lol if you like those type of films | Recommender: so kinda like Event Horizon  (1997) or Sunshine  (2007) ? | User: yes kind of similar | User: I will have to check those movies out | User: thanks for the suggestions you have a nice night | Recommender: Your welcome. Goodbye!\nRecommender: Good evening! | User: hey there | User: do you know any good romantic comedies | Recommender: I've got a few in mind. | User: yay | Recommender: If you like Joss Whedon and Shakespeare, check out Much Ado About Nothing  (2016) .  It's a modern retelling of the play (maintaining Elizabethan language) starring a lot of Mr.\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}], "parameters": {"model": "gpt-3.5-turbo", "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "temperature": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0}}}
