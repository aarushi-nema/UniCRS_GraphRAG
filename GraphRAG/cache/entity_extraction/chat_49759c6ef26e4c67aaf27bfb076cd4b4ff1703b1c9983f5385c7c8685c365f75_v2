I enjoyed Shaun of the Dead (2004) . Same thing with Get Out (2017), funny, but not really a comedy. | Recommender: The new Jumanji  (2017) was funny as well, but I think would fit more in the action category | Recommender: I see what you mean. Get Out (2017) did have its funny parts. | User: I haven't seen the new Jumanji  (2017) yet, I heard that it was surprisingly good. So, I will need to watch it. | Recommender: It is! Instead of a board game, they base it around a video game. | User: I like movies with The Rock, he's a fun actor. Do you have any other recommendations that he is in? | Recommender: Oh certainly. Did you know he was the voice for a lead role in the animated movie Moana  (2016)? | User: Moana  (2016) is great! I loved hearing him sing. | User: It sounds like you have good taste, so, I will definitely check out the new Jumanji  (2017). Thank you! | Recommender: Great! Hope you enjoy!
