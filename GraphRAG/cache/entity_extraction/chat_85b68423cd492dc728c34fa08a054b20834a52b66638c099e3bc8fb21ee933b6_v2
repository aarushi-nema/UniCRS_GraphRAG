There's Interstellar  (2014) with McConoughey (SP) lol. Also Sunshine  (2007) with Michelle Yeoh and Chris Evans. Similar films but different. | User: Are they anything like Life  (2017) ? | Recommender: No, no creature features. Just space and the trouble it could bring. | User: Okay. That's good. | Recommender: If you want space sci-fi, try Elysium  (2013) . Reminds me of District 9 (2009) in space. | User: Hmmm...not sure I'd like that one. Didn't care for District 9 (2009) . But I did like Event Horizon  (1997) . Not the same, I know but it came to mind. | Recommender: That was a good one. One of the few movies that legitimately creeped me out when I watched it. | User: Same here! Reminded me of my Hellraiser (1987) days. | Recommender: Agreed! | User: Thanks for the suggestions.

I enjoyed it a lot though. | Recommender: Ohh!! What about Cloverfield (2008) ? I know you said no kaiju monsters but this one is really good | User: I've heard it was good. But monsters smashing cities doesn't interest me. | Recommender: Well this one is more of a mystery than a smasher flick. | User: Okay. I might check it out. | Recommender: There's also 2 sequels. 10 Cloverfield Lane (2016) and The Cloverfield Paradox (2018) . Both are good but the story is far from over! | User: Okay, I'll check them out. Are they all on DVD? | Recommender: The first 2 are.
