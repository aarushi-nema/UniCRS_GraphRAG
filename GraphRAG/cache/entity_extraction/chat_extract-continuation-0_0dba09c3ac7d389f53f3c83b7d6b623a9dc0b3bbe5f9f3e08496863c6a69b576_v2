It's very gorey.Or there is always the classic A Nightmare on Elm Street (1984) | Recommender: Or another old school movie is Silent Night, Deadly Night (1984) | User: Can never go wrong with Freddy. :) | User: And the inferno film sounds like it might give my girlfriend the creeps. I'll see if Amazon has it for rental. :) | Recommender: Or the other classic Friday the 13th  (1980)  or It  (1966) | Recommender: Perfect! hope you enjoy it! | User: I've seen Silent Night, Deadly Night Part 2 (1987) . But not the first. | Recommender: The first one is a lot better than the sequel | User: So I've heard. But that shouldn't surprise me. The originals are always better. | User: Unless it's a sequel done by James Cameron, then all bets are off. :D | Recommender: Ha I so true, I love his films | Recommender: Well hope you like the suggestions, have a great day!\nRecommender: Hi! | User: hi | Recommender: What sorts of movies can I recommend for you tonight? | Recommender: I'm quite the movie buff. :) | User: Perfect! | User: I am looking for some good thriller movies | User: Like psychological thrillers | User: ISomething similar to Seven  (1995) and High Crimes (2002) | Recommender: Okay. In that case I would recommend Primal Fear  (1996) with Richard Gere and Edward Norton. | User: I love Edward Norton, what is that movie about&gt; | Recommender: I'd also recommend The Zodiac  (2005) with Jake Gylenhall. (sp) | User: I did enjoy that movie | Recommender: Primal Fear  (1996) is about a young boy (Norton) who is accused of murder and Gere is defending him in court. The case invovles sexual abuse in the catholic church but it's one serious twist after another. | Recommender: I would also recommend Fracture  (2007) with Anthony Hopkins and Ryan Gosling | User: Wow, that sounds so good!I think I will check that one out, you definitely sold me on that one.I also liked Kiss the Girls  (1997) with Ashley Judd too I love her and Morgan Freeman they make a great team. | User: I have heard about that movie with Ryan Gosling but have never seen it. | Recommender: They do. Almost wish she returned for the sequel in Along Came a Spider  (2001) | User: I saw that one! It was with that blonde actress from the tv show parenthood | User: I wish she did return too | Recommender: Yea. It was good, but not as good as the first film | User: Thank you the suggestions, you were very helpful! Have a great day!\nUser: Hi, how are you? | Recommender: I'm doing great! What kind of movies are you into? | User: I am looking for some good animated movies for the family | User: Something like The Good Dinosaur (2015) | User: Just family friendly movies for the kids | Recommender: Have you seen Zootopia? My kid loved that movie. | User: I know of all the well known one like Frozen  and Moana  (2016) | User: I actually have not seen that one with the kids, what is it about? | Recommender: She also really liked My Little Pony: The Movie  (2017), and I thought it was pretty cute. | Recommender: Zootopia was a Pixar movie, about a bunny cop trying to track down a missing person with a fox swindler. | User: Aw those sound really good, I think my kids will love those movies. Is there any ones for boys you would recommend? Something like the The Lego Movie (2014) ? | Recommender: I'd recommend Kubo and the Two Strings (2016). Lots of action! | User: I have never heard of these movies, if it has action I am sure my son will love it, thank you very much! | Recommender: Of course! | Recommender: Good bye and have a good night! | User: I hope you have a great christmas, have a great night!\nUser: Hello there! | Recommender: Hi! | User: I am looking for a good thriller movie | User: I love psychological thrillers like Seven  (1995) | User: I also love Prisoners  (2013) , basically just some movies with great twists | Recommender: Have you seen Oldboy  (2003)? The Korean version, not the new one from Spike Lee. | User: I have never seen or heard from that movie, does it have subtitles? I am not a fan of subtitles | Recommender: It's on Netflix now, and you can watch it either way there. It's one of my favorite. Awesome action scenes and very twisted. | Recommender: The Prestige  (2006) is a fun one too. | User: Okay well I will definitely look it into that one, are there any other movies? I love The Prestige  (2006) with Hugh Jackman! I love The Illusionist  (2010) because it reminds me of it as well but better | Recommender: Oh, one of my favorite movies that not many people have heard of is Lucky Number
