It's older so you might have to look around to find it but I enjoyed it. | Recommender: The most recent movie I've seen was Deadpool 2  (2018) . It's a bit vulgar and more of an action comedy but I have to say it does have a good message! | User: I'm kinda over super hero movies. But I'll check out Four Weddings and a Funeral (1994).
