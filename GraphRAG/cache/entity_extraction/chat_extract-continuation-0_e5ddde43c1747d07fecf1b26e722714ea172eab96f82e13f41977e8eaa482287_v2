Define &quot;good drama&quot;? | User: I dunno, lol. Something that makes you sit and think. Something about more than mindless killing or fight scenes. | Recommender: Gotcha. | Recommender: What about Postcards from the Edge  (1990) ? | Recommender: Or 28 Days  (2000) ? | User: I've seen 28 Days  (2000) . What's the former about? | Recommender: It's about addiction and ecovery as well. | User: Oh okay. Sounds good. | Recommender: It kind of reminds me of Terms of Endearment (1983) . | Recommender: But only a little. | User: Okay. I like it already. So far, lol | Recommender: I would also recommend In Her Shoes  (2005) . It's newer, but it's a good movie about family and respect. | Recommender: Kind of like Hanging Up (2000) . | User: I see. Is Goldie HAwn in the former? | Recommender: No. Toni Colettee and Cameron Diaz. | User: Okay. I like Toni colleettee. She's hot! | Recommender: Ummm.... I'll let you have the one. lol\nRecommender: Hello! How's it going? | User: Hey, I'm well. How are you? | Recommender: I'm doing great! Can I recommend some films to you? | User: Can you recommend any animated movies? | Recommender: Sure! | Recommender: Have you seen Sing  (2016) ? | Recommender: I just watched it with my boyfriend last night, and it was great! | User: I have, but I'm not a big fan of musicals. | Recommender: Well then I'm sure you'll enjoy this! It's great for all ages! | User: What about something similar to Inside Out  (2015) | Recommender: Ooh, let me think | Recommender: Have you seen The Good Dinosaur (2015) ? | Recommender: Or Up  (2009) ? | Recommender: Up  (2009) is a favorite of mine! | User: I saw both, I preferred Up  (2009) | Recommender: Alright, how about Coco  (2017) ? | User: I loved Coco  (2017) | User: I think we've seen all the same films lol | Recommender: Another that comes to mind, though not horribly related to inside out, is Moana  (2016) | Recommender: And yes, I'd have to agree! Hahaha | User: Moana  (2016)  was great, but I still love the classics like Mulan (1998) | Recommender: Yes, Mulan (1998) is where it's at! All of that being said though, I highly suggest checking out my first pick, Sing  (2016) :-) | User: Thanks for the recommendation. Maybe I'll watch Sing  (2016) again | User: Thanks for the chat. Have a great day. | Recommender: I am so sorry, I somehow misread your first two messages and thought you said you hadn't seen it, and that you did like musicals. My bad! The window wouldn't stay scrolled up | Recommender: You have a nice day as well though!\nUser: Hello | Recommender: Hi want kind of movie do you want to see ? | User: I'm interested in comedies | Recommender: Absurd like Airplane!

(1988) is more absurd | User: Anything more recent like Central Intelligence (2016) | User: I have heard of Airplane! (1980)  though, but not that familiar with the others | Recommender: There is The Death of Stalin which is in cinema as we speak | User: Sounds interesting.

I would like to find something family friendly but not animated. Suggestions? | User: Oh I forgot all about Air Bud (1997) .
