That sounds crazy?  Do you know of any more like that? | Recommender: I like Liam Neeson, like Taken  (2008), and Taken 2 (2012). | User: I haven't seen either of those.  I don't guess I watch much Liam Neeson.  Not that I don't like him just cause he wasn't on my radar | Recommender: He is very well rounded from Star Wars: Episode I – The Phantom Menace (1999), to Schindler's List (1993) he does it all. | User: Ok yep I have seen those too | User: two | User: I live in a house full of nerds so it's Star Wars constintly! | User: and Schindler's List was fantastic | Recommender: Yes it really was.

The only one she didn't ruin was The Color Purple  (1985). | User: I don't think I've seen that one either.  But it's not surprising if she's in it | Recommender: It's a period film set in lik the 20's or so Whoopi is in it. A classic, sad, but classic. | User: I'll have to watch it then!
