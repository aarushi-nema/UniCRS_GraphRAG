Nothing like Fifty Shades of Grey  (2015) though. | User: I prefer a little bit lighter romance. | Recommender: Yeah, that totally doesn't count. | Recommender: How about No Reservations  (2007)? | User: I haven't heard of it. What's it about? | Recommender: It's a story of a restaurant chef. Super cute. | User: Fun. I'll have to check it out. | Recommender: How about Amélie (2001)? | User: Is that in english. I am not really into subtitles. | Recommender: Oh, yeah it has subtitles. How about About Time  (2013)? | User: I liked The Notebook (2013) .

It's a good suggestion though. | Recommender: ok and then did you see, it's older a movie called Time Bandits (1981) | Recommender: entertaining but not academy award material | User: Yes I love the director. I'm so excited for his new movie coming soon. | Recommender: okay so you are a fantasy fan, so you've obviously seen the The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring (2001) | User: Haha yes I have. It is very good too. | Recommender: it wasn't a major hit, but I would suggest a movie called Willow  (1988) | Recommender: its a ron howard fantasy film | User: Sorry, I'm making this difficult. I've seen that too. Maybe I should find another genre. | Recommender: not too complex, lots of fantasy elements. | User: These are all good suggestions though. | Recommender: noooo! one more before we switch genres.... | Recommender: Kubo and the Two Strings (2016) | Recommender: it's animation which I normally don't like but this one was special | User: Oh, you're so close.
