Might have to check one of those out today. | Recommender: I keep seeing ads for Ingrid Goes West (2017) , but I have not yet seen that | User: Ill probably head to Rotten Tomato to see a trailer for Ingrid Goes West (2017) .

I really only liked the first one just because they got a a little repetitive\n. | User: What is War  (2007)  about. That sounds interesting and I love Jason Statham. | Recommender: If you want a sort of futuristic action movie The One  (2001) is really good. | Recommender: War  (2007) is a crime thriller, it has FBI, tracking Assasins, and asian mobsters. | User: Futuristic movies do sound interesting too I saw one George Clooney Tomorrowland  (2015) and loved that movie. | Recommender: I think you will really love The One  (2001) or even Edge of Tomorrow (2014) | Recommender: Some of the coolest futuristic action movies I have seen.
