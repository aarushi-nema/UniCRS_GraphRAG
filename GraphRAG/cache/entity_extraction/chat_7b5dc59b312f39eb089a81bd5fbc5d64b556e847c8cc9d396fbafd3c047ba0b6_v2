Have you seen The Notebook (2013) ? That's a big one amongst romance fans | User: I love the The Notebook (2013) a really great film. | Recommender: and if you liked Romeo and Juliet  (2007) then I have to reccommend Titanic  (1997) for Leo. | Recommender: Also a recent sweet romantic comedy was The Duff (2015) | User: Ahh the great Titanic  (1997) what a classic thanks for recommending that one. | User: I will definitely have to check out the The Duff (2015) thanks so much for your help! | Recommender: No problem! I have one more to suggest. Phantom Thread (2017) ! It's new and I didn't like it as much but a lot of others do! It tackles romance in a unique way | Recommender: No problem at all! I hope you enjoy the films you decide to  watch and enjoy the rest of your day! | User: Thanks I will defiantly check out the Phantom Thread (2017) I really appreciate it and you have a great day!\nRecommender: hey there | User: Hi there! | Recommender: What type of films are you into, pal? | User: Marvel and action movies like Suicide Squad  (2016). | User: Have you seen it? | Recommender: Not yet! People say mix things about it! Have you seen The Dark Knight  (2008) ? It's my fave superhero movie | User: What kind of movies are you into?  Have you seen the new Jumanji  (2017)  that is in theaters? | User: That was a good movie. I like Spider-Man: Homecoming (2017) | Recommender: I haven't yet but if you like Jumanji  (2017) you might also like another movie that blends humor, creatures, and action. Snakes on a Plane (2006) | Recommender: Another fun creature flick is Gremlins (1984). It's from the 80's so there's a good bunch of people who don't know about that one | User: I seen it and it was ok.  Do you like Action movies like The Long Kiss Goodnight (1996) | User: Yes that is an oldie but good. | User: What genre do you like? | Recommender: Actions are good depending on the Director! I think my favorite one was Crank  (2006). Gets me pumped thinking about it! | User: I don't think I have seen Crank  (2006) | Recommender: Also it's hard to go wrong with Tarantino so Kill Bill: Volume 1 (2003) is another favorite of mine | User: Transporter 3 (2008)  was another good action movie. | Recommender: Oh I definitely reccommend Crank  (2006) . It's so good, you won't regret! | Recommender: I hope you like it, bud. It was great chatting with you! | User: Great chatting with you.  Have a good weekend.\nRecommender: hello | User: Hello, I like funny dramas. | Recommender: nice I can help out | Recommender: have you seen Good Will Hunting (1997) | Recommender: It's a fave | User: I have a long time ago, but I do remember liking it. | Recommender: Another good funny drama is As Good as It Gets (1997) | User: I don't remember that one, it's possible I could have seen it, it's just not ringing a bell right now | Recommender: Gran Torino (2008) is more of a drama but it has it's comedic and touching moments | User: One of my favorite movies is 50 First Dates (2004) with Adam Sandler | Recommender: That's a sweet one! It reminds me of Shallow Hal (2001) | Recommender: I definitely recommend that one if you haven't seen | Recommender: Also Forgetting Sarah Marshall (2008) is similar to those | User: I haven't seen Gran Torino (2008)  but I love Shallow Hal (2001) | User: Thank you, you've given me some really good movies to check out! | Recommender: I hope you like my suggestions!! It was really great chatting with you and have a great rest of the weekend!\nRecommender: hey there | User: Hi! | Recommender: What type of films are you into? | User: I like funny, dramas, or action movies. | Recommender: Oh great! A comedy I like is National Lampoon's Vacation (1983) ! A drama I love is The Godfather (1972) | Recommender: My favorite action movie is Crank  (2006) | Recommender: I'd definitely recommend any of those if you haven't seen | User: I enjoyed The Godfather (1972), But I haven't saw the others. My favorite action movies are The Fast and the Furious  (2001) | Recommender: Never seen any of those!! I think Star Wars  (1977) might be a good suggestion if you like those. It may seem like an odd comparison but they both are fun high energy franchises with big fan bases. (and lots of films.) lol | User: I keep saying that I'm going to give Star Wars a try, just haven't got around to it yet. | Recommender: Also another car film I saw and kind of liked was Torque\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}], "parameters": {"model": "gpt-3.5-turbo", "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "temperature": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0}}}
