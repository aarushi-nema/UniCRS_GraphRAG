Something kinda like The Revenant  (2015) with Leonardo Dicaprio. | User: Or maybe something like Gone Girl  (2014) with Ben Afflect | Recommender: Ok cool. That definitely gives me a good start to think. | User: Have you seen any of those movies? | Recommender: I haven't, but I know of them and I am familiar with their stars. | Recommender: You might also really like Take  (2007) It is similar in that it is a really intense action film. | User: Oh ok. If you know of just any must see movies that would be great too. | User: I don't know of that movie. Who stars in it? | Recommender: It stars Jeremy Renner and Minnie Driver. | User: I love Minnie. I'll check out the trailer tonight. | Recommender: It's an indie thriller. Also you might enjoy The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo  (2009) it's another thriller staring a strong female. | Recommender: Do those sound good? | User: I haven't had a chance to watch that either.

Good bye!\nRecommender: Hi. | User: Hello. | User: What good movies have you seen lately? | Recommender: As far as recent movies, I enjoyed Thor: Ragnarok (2017) a lot more than I thought I would. | Recommender: It's got a soundtrack reminiscent of 80s Sci-Fi films and the comedy is perfectly spread out through the film.  Also, it's got Jeff Goldblum doing what he does best. | User: I haven't seen any of the thors | Recommender: I think it's the best of the bunch.  The only prerequisite viewing (if any) would be the second Thor, I think. | User: I'm a big fan or movies like Forrest Gump (1994)  and Billy Madison (1995) | Recommender: I also recently saw All's Faire in Love (2009).  It's Christina Ricci in a comedy set at a Rennaissance Faire.  The jokes are kind of raunchy, but I still enjoyed it. | User: That sounds interesting. | User: I saw Dunkirk  (2017) and I wasnt not at all interested in it. | Recommender: That's one I wanted to see last year, but I didn't find the time for it. | User: I couldn't stay focused. | Recommender: Did you see The Big Sick (2017) ? | User: No i've never seen that | Recommender: It's a Judd Apatow produced comedy about a man who's trying to reconcile his family's traditional values in marriage and his interest in a woman whom his family wouldn't consider...who also has a serious illness. | User: I'll look for it.
