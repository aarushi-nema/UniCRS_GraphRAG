I Love You  (2007) | Recommender: Hmm, I've never seen the second one. What about something like The Proposal  (2009) ? | User: I think I saw that. With Sandra BUllock and Ryan Reynolds? | User: Oh, don't waste your time on that second one. They said romantic comedy and her husband dies in the beginning and the whole thing is sad!! | Recommender: Oh wow! | Recommender: I didn't know that. | User: Sorry, spoilers! haha but really it is not worth it | User: Do you have any other suggestions? I think I saw the one you mentioned | User: I did like it | Recommender: Well what about Bridget Jones's Diary  (2001) ? I saw it and liked it. | User: I have honestly never seen that or the sequel | User: I don't know why. I heard it was good | User: Did you see the second one? | Recommender: They are. the original is much better than the sequel thought. It felt rushed in a way, like they were trying to hurry it through production. | User: Oh that's too bad when they do that. | User: I appreciate the suggestion and I will try that one. | User: Thank you and have a good night\nRecommender: Hello there. | Recommender: Can I help you find a good movie? | User: Hello, I like dramas and old black and white movies. | Recommender: Ok, great | Recommender: How about a holiday one like It's a Wonderful Life (1946) or maybe Mr. Smith Goes to Washington (1939) | Recommender: Have you seen either of those? | User: Yes, I've seen both and I love them. Jimmy Stewart is my favorite actor. | Recommender: I love him so much. So I guess maybe you have seen Rear Window (1954) with him too? | Recommender: How about a newer drama like Gone Girl  (2014) | User: Yes, I've seen Rear Window (1954). I haven't seen Gone Girl  (2014), though. | Recommender: Gone GIrl was different. It was good though | Recommender: Kind of long, but worth it | Recommender: Another you may like is Running Scared  (2006) with Paul Walker. Drama with a lot of action. Very intense, but great film! | User: I'll have to check it out. I don't usually like action movies, but I'm open to watching anything once.\nUser: Hi! | User: Could you help me find  good scary movie to wach tonight? | User: watch | Recommender: Have you seen the new It  (2017)  or Jigsaw (2017) ? | User: I have seen all the classics like Friday the 13th  (1980) and A Nightmare on Elm Street (1984) | User: I did see the new It  (2017) film and loved it!! | Recommender: Me too! | User: Don't think I would like the other just yet though | Recommender: Not into that sort of subgenre? | User: Haven't seen any of the Saw  (2004) films | User: I am, just somehow haven't started them yet | Recommender: Whaaaat!?! I thought everyone's seen at least one of them | User: I knowwwww, I am a horrible horror fan | Recommender: I liked them okay. Through I think the story was pieced together as they went along | User: I think I started the first and it was ok and then I got overwhelmed at the rate they were releasing new ones | Recommender: I think that's what happened to a lot of people. Myself included. I liked them, but the story didn't require 7 movies to complete. Even The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring (2001) concluded in 3 films | User: I haven't seen any of those either lol | Recommender: *faints* | User: hahaha And I seriously love movies and watch all the time | User: It just didn't look appealing and it has sooo much media coverage, almost makes me not want to watch | User: Did you love them? | User: Maybe I will give those a try | Recommender: I did' But not so much The Hobbit  films | User: Ok, I will try the LOTR ones then | User: Thanks for your help today! Have a good night\nUser: Heya | User: How you doing? | Recommender: Hello, I'm good. What kind of movies do you like? | User: I like most things besides scifi.
