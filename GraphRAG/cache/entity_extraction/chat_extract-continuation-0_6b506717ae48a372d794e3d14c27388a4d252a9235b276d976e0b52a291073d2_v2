Oh wow I didn't know it was directed by Clint Eastwood | User: But that would definitely make sense, he has a good sense of these kind of movies | Recommender: He was an actor in The Good, the Bad and the Ugly (1966) a classic western. | Recommender: One of my favorite Clint Eastwood Films. | User: Oh I heard about that one but I haven't ever gotten around to watching it. Thanks for reminding me! | Recommender: Also check out Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid (1969) that was a really cool outlaw movie. | Recommender: It has a great ending that I am sure you will enjoy. | User: Okay absolutely. I love the idea of how outlaws used to live back then | User: Anyway, thanks for the suggestions. Have a great night! | User: Bye | Recommender: As a bonus check out Tombstone  (1993) my mom was actually in that movie. | Recommender: Bye :)\\ | User: Wow that's awesome to have your mom in a movie, well thanks. Bye\nRecommender: Hello! | User: Hello! | Recommender: What kind of movies are you interested in? | User: I like movies that are based on books. I like Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire  (2005) and Les Misérables  (2012). | User: Any good suggestions? | Recommender: Sure! A couple good ones are The Dark Tower  (2017) based off of the Stephen King book. It's kind of a sci fi western sort of thing. | User: I've heard of it. Who was in it? | User: That sounds really good. | Recommender: The main characters are Idris Elba and Matthew McConnaughey. | User: Okay. Those two are great. I'll have to watch it. It sounds kind of different from Stephen King's normal stuff. | User: Any other suggestions? | Recommender: It is! Yes, another good one is Lemony Snicket's A Series of Unfortunate Events (2004) ! | Recommender: It's much better than the current TV show. It only covers the first three books though. | User: I have seen that one. It is so weird and quirky. I loved it. | User: That is kind of my thing. | Recommender: I am sure you'd love it if you are a fan of fantasy and fun characters! | User: Yes. It was good. | Recommender: I hope I was able to help! | User: Yes, you did. Thank you! Have a great night! | Recommender: You too!\nRecommender: Hello! | Recommender: What movies are you interested in? | User: Hello, I'm interested in Comedies | Recommender: Okay cool, any ones in specific you like? | User: My favorites are The Princess Bride  (1987) and Monty Python and the Holy Grail (1975) | Recommender: Both great movies. | Recommender: Have you seen Planes, Trains and Automobiles (1986) with Steve Martin? Absolutely hilarious! | Recommender: Another good one is Caddyshack (1980) - a Bill Murray classic. | User: I haven't, I'll have to add it to my list. I really like Caddyshack (1980) though, that's a classic. | User: Do you know anything similar to Caddyshack (1980) ? | Recommender: Yes, have you seen Groundhog Day  (1993) ? | User: I haven't. That also has Bill Murray, right? | Recommender: It does. Another comedy in a similar light hearted vein. A really great movie though. If you like Caddyshack (1980) you will like it. | User: I definitely have to check it out | Recommender: Awesome, I am glad I could help. | User: Thanks for helping me find some movies. | User: Have a good night. | Recommender: No problem! Have a good night.\nRecommender: Hello! | User: Hello! | Recommender: What kind of movies are you interested in? | User: I'm looking for a good family movie to watch. Do you have any that you like? We just watched Coco  (2017) and really enjoyed it. | User: It does not have to be animated. | Recommender: Sure, do you like ones with music? Or just family in general? | User: We love music! But any suggestions are great. | Recommender: Well if you liked Coco  (2017) , two good options are Moana  (2016) and Frozen (2013) . Both are fun, and have great music, and family friendly. | Recommender: I recently watched The Lego Batman Movie (2017) with my son and we loved that one as well. It was so funny! | User: I've seen both of them. I really liked them! | Recommender: Also, Diary of a Wimpy Kid: The Long Haul  came out last summer I believe, that was a really fun one. | User: I haven't seen that one. My kids have read the books, but we'll need to see that.
