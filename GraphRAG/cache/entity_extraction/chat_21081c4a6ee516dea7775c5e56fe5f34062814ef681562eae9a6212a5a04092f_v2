Another one along that vein was Inkheart  (2008) | User: It was really fantastic looking too | Recommender: Inkheart  (2008) is great as well! | User: Yeah I like really pretty movies.  Action is ok but I like eye candy.  If you throw action in there too then I can get the rest of my family to watch it too | Recommender: If you like eye candy, and don't mind something a bit more dark, you might want to try Pan's Labyrinth (2006). | User: Oooh that one is a really good movie too!
