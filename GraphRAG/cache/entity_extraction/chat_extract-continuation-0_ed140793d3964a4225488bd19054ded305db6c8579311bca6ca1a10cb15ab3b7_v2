But it's a pretty similar copy really. | User: Footloose  (1984) is great! | User: the remake Footloose  (2011)  wasnt too bad either | Recommender: I haven't seen that version. I've seen the Broadway play though. It was really enjoyable. | User: i have to see that some time | Recommender: With musicals I generally prefer the live versions.
