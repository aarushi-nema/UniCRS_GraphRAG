What's it about? | Recommender: It stars Jake Gyllenhaal as a &quot;  troubled teenager is plagued by visions of a man in a large rabbit suit who manipulates him to commit a series of crimes, after he narrowly escapes a bizarre accident&quot; | User: Oh wow. That definitely sounds intriguing! Thanks for the recommendations! | Recommender: You are welcome. Have a great night.\nRecommender: Hello. | User: Hello, I'm looking for a horror movie with no gore, like Paranormal Activity (2007) | Recommender: Then you must check out The Conjuring (2013) or The Conjuring 2 (2016)  if you haven't already. | User: I haven't seen either one of those. What are they about? | Recommender: First of all there is no gore which is a huge plus. They are about hauntings and Ed and Lorraine Warren and some of the people they have helped. | User: Ooh that sounds like my kind of movie! | Recommender: They are 2 of my favorites!  I am not a huge fan of gory horror movies so they were perfect and I enjoyed both. | User: I'm not either. I also like The Omen (1976) | Recommender: Another non-gory movie is The Fourth Kind (2009)  which is not gory but is a horror/thriller. | Recommender: The Omen is a freaky freaky movie. | User: I haven't seen that one either | Recommender: It's a very good one alien abduction related. But a very good watch! | User: Sounds good. Thanks for the suggestions! | Recommender: Happy to help. Have a great night.\nUser: Hi! | Recommender: Hi there. | User: I was hoping to find a really good suspense/thriller | User: Maybe something like The Revenant  (2015) | User: That movie starred Leonardo Dicaprio | User: Have you seen that movie before? | Recommender: I haven't watched that one. What's it about and maybe I can make some suggestions you would like. | User: How about Gone Girl  (2014) . Could you recommend a movie similar to that one? | Recommender: Have you seen Kiss the Girls  (1997)  ? | User: I think that movie had Morgan Freeman right | User: I liked that movie too! | Recommender: Yes he is in it. | Recommender: How about Basic Instinct (1992) or Sliver  (1993) ? | User: Which one would you recommend? Ive never seen either of them | Recommender: I enjoyed @Sliver more because I liked the storyline much better. | User: Thanks for the advice. I'll check that movie out later! | User: Thanks again! | Recommender: Ok great.

It sounds like she enjoys Disney Princesses which is lovely. If you want to go really girly, there is always The Secret Garden  (1993) even though it is not animated. | User: She loved The Princess and the Frog . | User: She hasn't seen that movie yet but she loves A Little Princess  (1995) | Recommender: Have you shown her Mulan (1998) yet? | User: I think she'll enjoy it. | User: Thanks for your help | Recommender: I think The Secret Garden  (1993) might be right up her alley!

I don't think i've heard of that one yet. I'll have to check it out. | User: Have you by chance seen Memento  (2000) ? | User: Everyone keeps telling me how good it is. | Recommender: Memento  (2000) is a fantastic movie and I highly suggest it! | User: Thanks for the recommendations! | Recommender: You should also try the movie Blow  (2001) which is a great depiction of a cocaine smuggler's life. | Recommender: You're very welcome, have a great day!
