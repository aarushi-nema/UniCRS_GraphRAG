He had a real run of Disney movies | User: I might watch that tonight! | User: thanks a lot! | Recommender: no problem\nUser: HI | Recommender: Hello. | Recommender: Do you have something in mind you would like suggestions for? | User: I'm looking for a sports documentary | Recommender: Have you ever seen Murderball  (2005) ? I watched it in a college class concerning people with disabilities and I thought it was great. | User: I have seen it I liked it. I just watched Senna  (2010) i think something like that would be good | Recommender: Kicking and Screaming  (1995)  is a BBC documentary. I only watched part of it but it seemed interesting. | User: I haven't seen it what is it about? | Recommender: English football and some history concerning how the sport has evolved | User: That sounds good, i don't know much about soccer | Recommender: Have you ever seen Tyson  (1995) ? I'm not sure that is what you're looking for as it focuses mainly on one person but it was a good movie. | User: I did see that, I didn't love it. | User: Thanks for you help! bye\nUser: Hi | Recommender: Hello. | Recommender: What genre are you interested in? | User: I'm looking for a funny romantic movie | Recommender: It shouldn't be too hard to come up with those. There are lots of movies in that category. Have you seen Fool's Gold  (2008) ? | User: I have it was ok | Recommender: Maid in Manhattan  was a fun movie. Notting Hill   was decent and Julia Roberts starred. | User: I love both of those, something along those lines would be great | Recommender: What do you think of Bridget Jones's Diary  (2001) ? | User: No, is it good? | User: who is in it? | User: Any other suggestions? | Recommender: I liked it. it sort of reminded me of historical romances, although it is set in modern times. Another one that really is more of a historical romance is Just Visiting  (2001) | Recommender: I'll have to think a minute of the actresses name. | Recommender: Renee Zellweger. | User: ok, I'll check it out. Thanks for you help. Have a good night\nUser: Hello | Recommender: Hiya | User: I'm in the mood to watch a comedy.  I really enjoyed Bridesmaids  (2011) and Knocked Up (2007) .

I loved her in Identity Thief (2013) | Recommender: And since you like Katherine Heigl films, perhaps The Ugly Truth (2009) ? | User: Awesome, thanks for the ideas! | User: Have a good night! | Recommender: No problem. You as well. | Recommender: Thanks.\nRecommender: Hello. | User: Hello. | Recommender: Hope you are having a great night. What kind of movie are you interested in? | User: I was hoping to discover some good movies based on animals of some kind such as Born Free (1966) | User: I am, Thank you. I hope your night is going well too. | Recommender: Well Old Yeller  (1957) is truly a classic. | User: Yes it is. I enjoyed the movie but it was the sort of heartbreaking enjoyment that means I'll never watch it again. I have similar feelings concerning Where the Red Fern Grows  (2003) | Recommender: So you would like something a bit more &quot;happy&quot;? | User: That would be ideal but I can watch those with tragic endings, I just only watch them once. | Recommender: I don't like the sad endings either. | User: The NeverEnding Story  (1984)  was complete fiction and Artax came back at the end but I still cried when I watched it. | Recommender: How about Turner & Hooch (1989) ? | User: I have not seen that. I'll check it out. | Recommender: Yes I still cry with The NeverEnding Story  (1984) . | Recommender: I do recommend Turner & Hooch (1989) especially if you like Tom Hanks movies. | User: Cool.
