Great movie. | User: Ooh that sounds right up my alley. | Recommender: The Curious Case of Benjamin Button  (2008) would be a good one too! | User: I haven't seen that one, but I remember the previews for it, and it looked really good. | Recommender: Hm, how about The Time Traveler's Wife  (2009) ? | User: I've seen bits and pieces of it, and I really liked it | Recommender: It's really a touching movie. | User: It is. Thanks for the suggestions | Recommender: You're welcome!\nRecommender: Hi, how are you doing? | User: Hello, I'm good. I'm looking for a drama. | Recommender: Hm, any specific type of drama? | User: Maybe something along the lines of Gran Torino (2008) | User: Not too much action | Recommender: Million Dollar Baby (2004) is an amazing movie. She's got something to prove and that makes it a good watch. | User: I haven't seen that one, yet. | User: The previews looked good, though | Recommender: It's a good movie. Invictus  (2009) is another good one and it was directed by the same man that directed Gran Torino (2008) | User: I haven't seen that one, either. But I like anything with Clint Eastwood | Recommender: So is Hereafter  (2010) | Recommender: Clint Eastwood directed that one too! | User: I haven't that one, but I'll definitely have to check them out | Recommender: The last one I have for you is Dirty Harry (1971). It's a bit older, but it's still got a solid plot. | User: I haven't seen that one, but I've heard great things about it. | User: Thanks for the suggestions! | Recommender: No problem, hope I helped a little bit! | User: It did. Bye!\nRecommender: Hello! | User: Hello! | User: I'm looking for an animated movie. | User: It can be classic or modern | Recommender: Hm, similar to Disney movies or more on the Anime side? | User: Disney | Recommender: Gotcha.

Have you seen The Iron Giant (1999) ? | User: I haven't seen that. What's it about? | Recommender: A young boy befriends a giant robot from outer space that the government wants to destroy. I remember watching it when I was maybe 5 years old! | User: Ooh that sounds interesting | Recommender: It is. 101 Dalmatians  (1996) is one of the best Disney movies out there, second to Bambi (1942) of course. | Recommender: Up  (2009) is also a great one! | User: I loved Up  (2009) I haven't seen 101 Dalmatians  (1996) though | Recommender: 101 Dalmatians  (1996) is a great family movie to watch! Fantasia (1940) is a really old one, but nonetheless it's still another great movie. It's more of a musical though. | Recommender: I hope I helped you a little bit! | User: I didn't really care for Fantasia (1940) when I was little, but I'd probably appreciate it more now as an adult. | User: You did, thanks! | Recommender: Have a good night!\nUser: Hello, I'm looking for an animated movie. | Recommender: Hello there. | User: Maybe something like Toy Story (1995) | Recommender: What do you think about the Toy Story (1995) &gt; | Recommender: yes, that is a great movie. | User: Yeah it is | Recommender: I personally have watched them all, including Toy Story 4 (2018) | User: I've only watched the first one. | Recommender: You might also want to check out Frozen  (2010) | Recommender: The songs are catchy | User: I haven't seen it, either.
