Similar titles would be nice | Recommender: Or there's also The Shining  (1980) or It (1990) | User: I've never seen the original The Shining  (1980) . So many told me it was boring. Is it? | User: Have you seen it? | Recommender: I have. I would agree if you are use to today's horror films it may seem boring | User: No, I prefer the older films. They have better stories.

It's animated but the story hits home in a lot of ways. | Recommender: Then there's Collateral Beauty (2016) with Will Smith and Helen Mirren. | Recommender: Also, though it's not a &quot;tear jerer&quot; per se, the ending did make me cry a bit. Odd Thomas  (2013) with Anton Yelnich.
