-Goal-
Given a text document that is potentially relevant to this activity and a list of entity types, identify all entities of those types from the text and all meaningful relationships among the identified entities.

-Steps-
1. Identify all entities. For each identified entity, extract the following information:
   - entity_name: Name of the entity, capitalized
   - entity_type: One of the following types: [{entity_types}]
   - entity_description: Comprehensive description of the entity's attributes and activities
Format each entity as ("entity"{tuple_delimiter}<entity_name>{tuple_delimiter}<entity_type>{tuple_delimiter}<entity_description>)

2. From the entities identified in step 1, identify all pairs of (source_entity, target_entity) that are *clearly related* to each other. 
   For each pair of related entities, extract the following information:
   - source_entity: Name of the source entity, as identified in step 1
   - target_entity: Name of the target entity, as identified in step 1
   - relationship_description: explanation as to why you think the source entity and the target entity are related to each other
   - relationship_strength: a numeric score indicating strength of the relationship between the source entity and target entity
Format each relationship as ("relationship"{tuple_delimiter}<source_entity>{tuple_delimiter}<target_entity>{tuple_delimiter}<relationship_description>{tuple_delimiter}<relationship_strength>)
DO NOT mention relationships like "<entity_name> is not a scary movie" or "Both movies were mentioned by the user". MAKE SURE THAT THE RELATIONSHIPS ARE MEANINGFUL.

3. Return output in English as a single list of all the entities and relationships identified in steps 1 and 2. Use **{record_delimiter}** as the list delimiter.

4. When finished, output {completion_delimiter}
