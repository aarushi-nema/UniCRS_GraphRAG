But, if you've seen it before, it would probably be ruined for a 2nd viewing. The twist makes that movie and once you know it, it can't be unknown. I like the Annabelle (2014) movie. I haven't seen the 2nd one yet."}
{"pred": "System: Yes, I have seen it. It was good.", "label": "System: I'm not sure if I have or not. That sounds like The Sixth Sense (1999) once you've seen it the twist is gone. Annabelle (2014) is a good one for sure."}

{"pred": "System: That sounds like a good one. I'll check it.", "label": "System: How about Bridget Jones's Diary (2001)? That's a funny comedy with a warped kind of love interest. I have to look up True Romance (1993). It sounds interesting."}
{"pred": "System: That sounds like a good one. I will check it.", "label": "System: I have seen it, but it has been a very long time since I have watched it. True Romance (1993) is great. I highly recommend that movie."}
{"pred": "System: That sounds like a good one. I will check it.", "label": "System: Cool. I will look at that. Wristcutters: A Love Story (2006) is a crazy kind of love story as well. I hope I have helped you out?"}

{"pred": "System: Oh, I haven't seen that one. I will have to check it out.", "label": "System: Or one that I always thought was a great movie American Psycho (2000)."}
{"pred": "System: I have seen that one, it was great.", "label": "System: I've heard of it, but have never watched it. I will have to check it out. any others?"}
{"pred": "System: Yes I like The Blues Brothers (1980)", "label": "System: For sure it is a really good movie gets in your head. I will always suggest Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas (1998). I've seen the movie and read the book, for sure a great one."}

{"pred": "System: I like the movie The Matrix (1999)", "label": "System: There is a movie called The Change-Up (2011) where two guys somehow switch bodies"}
{"pred": "System: I haven't seen that one. I'll have to check it out.", "label": "System: I've never heard of that one. Sounds interesting! It could also be a movie where a person swaps roles but not bodies, like The Parent Trap (1998)"}
{"pred": "System: It's a movie about a couple of couples who are trying to switch bodies. It's about a guy who is trying to get his girlfriend to change his life.", "label": "System: Or The Hot Chick (2002), sort of a funny version of how body swapping can go horribly wrong."}
{"pred": "System: I haven't seen that one either. I'll have to check it out.", "label": "System: Right! That movie is crazy. I haven't seen it in awhile, either."}

{"pred": "System: I love that one. I love the old Halloween (1977) movies. Yes, that one is a classic.", "label": "System: Yes that is one of my all time favorite movies. Right up there with A Nightmare on Elm Street (1984)."}
{"pred": "System: I love that one.", "label": "System: I never get tired of the old movies like Phantasm (1979). The dialogue is a bit stiff, but the concept and scares are great. Freddy Krueger is the man of horror for sure!"}
{"pred": "System: Oh I love that one. I love the old horror movies too.", "label": "System: I don't think that I have ever watched that one before. I will have to look it up."}
{"pred": "System: It's a classic!", "label": "System: Do you like old ones like Rosemary's Baby (1968)?"}
{"pred": "System: No, I don’t think I have seen that one. I'll check it out.", "label": "System: I have heard of it but I have never actually watched it. I suppose I am going to have to check it out now."}
{"pred": "System: It's a classic.", "label": "System: Oh, and one that I remember scaring me when I was young was It's Alive (1974). I wonder if it would scare me now? I remember it was gory. Definitely see Rosemary's Baby (1968). It has held up well."}
{"pred": "System: Yes, I love that one. I love the older ones. I think I will check it.", "label": "System: I've never seen that one either. I guess I have a few movies to look up now."}
{"pred": "System: It's a classic.", "label": "System: I hope you have something here you can use?"}

{"pred": "System: I like the The Silence Of The Lambs", "label": "System: I just saw A Quiet Place (2018) a couple days ago. Its more monster horror but it was still a nice movie to watch Sadly, I am not a huge fan of horror so I can't really help you there"}
{"pred": "System: Sounds good. I will check it out.", "label": "System: I saw that, I thought it was an excellent use of silence in a horror film, especially for a first time director"}
{"pred": "System: Yeah, I think I will watch it. Thanks for the suggestions.", "label": "System: Yea and it was a great thing that they casted an actual deaf girl to play the role. Makes the movie feel more real after learning that"}
{"pred": "System: That sounds like a good movie, I'll have to check it out.", "label": "System: Yes, representation is important Have you seen any good comedies lately?"}
{"pred": "System: No, I haven't seen any of them.", "label": "System: No I have not, have you. I been meaning to watch some."}

{"pred": "System: I'm doing well. How are you?", "label": "System: Doing fine, and you?"}
{"pred": "System: I'm doing well thanks!", "label": "System: Good thanks for asking what kind of movies do you like?"}
{"pred": "System: I like horror movies like The Conjuring (2013) and The Conjurations (2012)", "label": "System: I tend to like things that are visually distinctive with multiple layers to work with. I lean towards animation most of the time because of its expressiveness. A good example would be the bleakness of Waltz with Bashir (2008), an animated documentary that just throws away objectivity and tries to recreate a war moment through the eyes of its participants. What do you tend to like in films?"}
{"pred": "System: Oh yes! I like that one!", "label": "System: Hmm that’s pretty cool I will have to check that out and pay attention to it! I like comedy and action especially Inception (2010)"}
{"pred": "System: Oh, I think you might like Inception, too!", "label": "System: Have you seen any of the Three Flavours Cornetto trilogy ( Shaun of the Dead (2004), Hot Fuzz (2007), The World's End (2013) )? They're delightful combinations of genre satire and genre tributes with tight cinematography and a delightful wit, directed by the person behind Baby Driver (2017). They're quite British, but are otherwise extremely distinct and, despite not being connected in terms of story, feel like a cohesive series. (they also have running gags throughout, some of which are things brought up very early in the films and come back as a punchline you'd almost forget)"}
{"pred": "System: I have seen that one, I like the first one. I will check out the other one. Thanks for the suggestions!", "label": "System: I haven’t but I will add them to my list for sure!"}
{"pred": "System: I hope you enjoy them!", "label": "System: Any other films you like in particular?"}
{"pred": "System: I like action, comedy, and comedy.", "label": "System: I usually watch American films"}
{"pred": "System: I like to watch movies like The Matrix (1999) and The Matrix Reloaded (1999).", "label": "System: In that case, I can just recommend the aforementioned Baby Driver (2017), a fun and tightly-choreographed action film packed with wit, a heist film where almost everything is in sync with the music."}
{"pred": "System: I have seen that one, but I haven't seen it yet. I'll have to check it out.", "label": "System: Is it on Netflix?!"}
{"pred": "System: I think so, I think it is on Netflix.", "label": "System: I'm not sure, but I can check not at this point, unfortunately"}
{"pred": "System: Okay, I'll check it out. Thanks for the suggestions!", "label": "System: Ahhh dang no worries I’m sure I will be able to find it somewhere even the video store!"}
{"pred": "System: You should check it out!", "label": "System: To top things off (and fulfill my requirements), there's an anime film from a highly-regarded director that inspired many elements of Inception (2010), Paprika (2006) by Satoshi Kon. It's not to everyone's taste, but it might be worth a go if you want that kind of surreal head trip. Unfortunately, I'm running low on time, so I'll have to stop there. I hope that at least some of these are appealing and that you find at least one enjoyable. Have a good evening."}
{"pred": "System: Oh yeah, I've seen that one. It was really good.", "label": "System: No problem I really appreciate your thoughts burn :)"}
{"pred": "System: Hi!", "label": "System: Hello I love action movies Do you know any good ones?"}
{"pred": "System: I like action movies like The Raid (2001)", "label": "System: Me too! I am a big fan of Die Hard (1988)"}
{"pred": "System: I have never seen that one. I will have to check it out.", "label": "System: WOW that is also one of my most favorite action movies"}
{"pred": "System: Die Hard 2 (1990) is a good one", "label": "System: It's a classic"}
{"pred": "System: Die Hard 2 (1990) is a classic too", "label": "System: My favorite is probably Terminator 2: Judgment Day (1991)"}
{"pred": "System: I have not seen that one", "label": "System: That is also a solid choice! The best of the terminator films"}
{"pred": "System: I also like The Terminator (1984)", "label": "System: Oh yea for sure easily"}
{"pred": "System: I also like the The Terminator (1984)", "label": "System: Do you watch any international action films?"}
{"pred": "System: I like the The Terminator (1984)", "label": "System: Yes Korean action movies are my favorite Such as Oldboy (2003) and I Saw the Devil (2010)"}
{"pred": "System: I have not seen that one. I will have to check it out.", "label": "System: have you seen The Man from Nowhere (2010) I love both of those!!"}
{"pred": "System: I have not seen that one. I will have to check it out.", "label": "System: No that is the one action movie from Korea that I have not seen surprisingly I just could not find a good quality version of that movie"}
{"pred": "System: I think I will watch it.", "label": "System: It used to be on netflix"}
{"pred": "System: I will check it out", "label": "System: Dang I would have checked it out for sure. I have heard great things about that Have you seen The Chaser (2008) Another solid korean action movie"}
{"pred": "System: I have seen it, it was good. I think I will watch it again", "label": "System: Train to Busan (2016) is also excellent No I'll look into that for sure"}
{"pred": "System: I will check it out", "label": "System: Yea but I felt that movie was too melodramatic but I still enjoyed it a lot"}
{"pred": "System: I think I'll watch it again", "label": "System: The ending really got me"}
{"pred": "System: I think I'll watch it again", "label": "System: Yea I saw it coming but it was still sad to see Hated the businessman so much in that movie"}
{"pred": "System: I think I'll watch it again", "label": "System: Yeah I was just waiting for him to die, he lived longer than I thought he would"}
{"pred": "System: I think I will watch that one", "label": "System: Well do you know any good thrillers? Like Gone Girl (2014)"}
{"pred": "System: I have seen it, but I don't think I will watch it again", "label": "System: Seven (1995) is one of my favorites"}
{"pred": "System: I have seen that one and I love it", "label": "System: Yea it is one of my favorites too. David Fincher just knows how to make really nice movies You should watch The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo (2011) if you have not seen it yet"}
{"pred": "System: I have not, but I will check it out", "label": "System: Oh I did watch the original, not the american remake I have really enjoyed this conversation, I'm glad we got matched up"}

{"pred": "System: I have not seen either of those. I will have to check them out.", "label": "System: I saw them, they were ok"}

And, if you like Jumanji (1995), did you ever see the most recent Jumanji (2017)? It was funny. Definitely a different concept."}
