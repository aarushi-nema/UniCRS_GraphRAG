Thank you for the suggestion! | Recommender: It is. The only downside is that the twist becomes a little obvious toward the end, but still a good movie | User: Usually now a days people can always guess the endings because they make it so obvious. But as long as it isn't dull and boring I am sure I'll like it. | User: Thank you for the movies, I am definitely going to watch the one with Johnny Depp. Thanks again! Have a good day, goodbye!
User: Hi how are you? | User: I am looking for some good drama/thriller movies. | Recommender: im good yourself? | User: I love movies like Double Jeopardy  (1999) | Recommender: Okay let me see....... have you seen The Resident (2011) with Hilary Swank? | Recommender: Also Nocturnal Animals  (2016) is also a good one. | User: Kiss the Girls  (1997) is another one my favorites. Is that the movie when the guy from greys anatomy is a stalker and looks in her room? | User: Because that is a great movie! | User: I watched Nocturnal Animals  (2016) but it was a little confusing for me. | Recommender: really? I thought it was pretty good. | Recommender: what about The Accountant  (2016) with Ben Affleck? | User: That was a good movie! It was really good | Recommender: And while I'm thinking about it, Split (2017) with James McAvoy is an intense film. Not as intense as say, Seven  (1995) , but it's still good. | User: The Life of David Gale (2003) is another murder mystery movie that I love because it's sort of similar to Seven  (1995) which I love. | User: I have seen Split (2017) which was good. | Recommender: I've never seen The Life of David Gale (2003) . Who's in it? | User: Kevin Spacey is starring in it with Kate Winslet, it is about a man who is accused of murder, but he was an activist against the death penalty, but it's ironic because now he is on death row for a murder he claims he did not commit. | Recommender: Oh okay. Sounds almost like Just Cause  (1995) with Sean Connery. | User: Never seen that one, but I will check that one out! | User: Thank you for the suggestions! | User: Have a nice day. | Recommender: You're welcome. Enjoy!
User: Hi! Can you recommend some good dark Christmas movies? | Recommender: Dark Christmas? I'll give it a shot. | Recommender: Okay I've got a few! | Recommender: First up is A Christmas Horror Story (2015) | Recommender: This one is a collection of short films with dark Christmas themes. Krampus being one of them | Recommender: There's also Krampus  (2015) itself. It's good. My kids liked it. But it's just on the edge of scary/creepy. It doesn't do much to terrify you though | User: Is that the one with Stefania Owen? | User: And Toni Collette? | Recommender: It is. Have you seen it? | User: No but I've seen the first few minutes of it on HBO. Looked good but I fell asleep, lol | Recommender: There's also Santa's Slay (2005) . It's a cheesy slasher flick with Santa as the killer. | User: oh god! lol | Recommender: My thoughts exactly | Recommender: Last there's Silent Night, Deadly Night (1984) about a kid who goes on a homicidal rage dressed as Santa. Pretty decent | User: I think I've seen that one. But I'll cehck it out again to be sure. | User: Thanks for the suggestions friend! | Recommender: no probl. night!

That definitely gives me a good start to think. | User: Have you seen any of those movies? | Recommender: I haven't, but I know of them and I am familiar with their stars. | Recommender: You might also really like Take  (2007) It is similar in that it is a really intense action film. | User: Oh ok.

Recommender: Hi. | User: Hello. | User: What good movies have you seen lately? | Recommender: As far as recent movies, I enjoyed Thor: Ragnarok (2017) a lot more than I thought I would. | Recommender: It's got a soundtrack reminiscent of 80s Sci-Fi films and the comedy is perfectly spread out through the film.  Also, it's got Jeff Goldblum doing what he does best. | User: I haven't seen any of the thors | Recommender: I think it's the best of the bunch.  The only prerequisite viewing (if any) would be the second Thor, I think. | User: I'm a big fan or movies like Forrest Gump (1994)  and Billy Madison (1995) | Recommender: I also recently saw All's Faire in Love (2009).  It's Christina Ricci in a comedy set at a Rennaissance Faire.  The jokes are kind of raunchy, but I still enjoyed it. | User: That sounds interesting. | User: I saw Dunkirk  (2017) and I wasnt not at all interested in it. | Recommender: That's one I wanted to see last year, but I didn't find the time for it. | User: I couldn't stay focused. | Recommender: Did you see The Big Sick (2017) ? | User: No i've never seen that | Recommender: It's a Judd Apatow produced comedy about a man who's trying to reconcile his family's traditional values in marriage and his interest in a woman whom his family wouldn't consider...who also has a serious illness. | User: I'll look for it.  It sounds interesting.  Thank you | Recommender: No problem.  I hope you enjoy it!  Take care! | User: Have a good night!

The Conjuring 2 (2016) was much better. | Recommender: Poltergeist  (1982) was another horror movie I would suggest | Recommender: The Shining  (1980) is another option. | User: I haven't seen that one, sounds interesting. The Shining  (1980) scared me for whatever reason haha | Recommender: I guess thats the point of a horror movie LOL. | Recommender: I hope you will like Poltergeist  (1982)  and I was able to help. | User: That it is!

Great drama and based on a true story. | Recommender: I was certainly alive for  The Empire Strikes Back (1980) ! | User: That is even better. Sometimes the ones based on true stories are the best, such as A Time to Kill  (1996) . | User: Thank you for your suggestions. | User: I really appreciate it. | Recommender: Yes, that was a good one. | Recommender: Glad I could give you some suggestions. Hope you enjoy them and have a great weekend! | User: You too!

Both of those were great thoughto-provoking movies! | User: If you could suggest anything in a similar vein, that would be great! | Recommender: Thought provoking is always good!

I'll have to check it out. | Recommender: Those kind really interest me too. | User: However, it is like a virus that can operate on itself and maybe hope for the worst for it can shut down the entire power grid on its own. | User: I highly recommend. | Recommender: I will definitely watch that. | Recommender: One that I watched a little while ago was Korengal. | User: I liked that film. | User: I also like Pacquiao: The Movie (2006) | Recommender: That one was really good. | Recommender: I haven't seen that one.

Recommender: Good evening! | User: Hello! | Recommender: Whats kind of movies do you like and what have you hated seeing? | User: Hated seeing... Let's see. | User: Let me tell you what I like first. | User: Because you asked that first.  :) | User: I like classic movies for sure. | User: And I like when they're remastered. | User: But classic cinema, even foreign, is a favorite of mine.  Especially if they're classic. | User: I mean, 'celebrated' classics | Recommender: well. here we go then! | User: So any Golden Era Hollywood flick. | Recommender: The Wizard of Oz  (1939) | User: Genre doesn't matter. | Recommender: Casablanca  (1942) | User: Gotta say I love The Wizard of Oz  (1939) | Recommender: and of course To Kill a Mockingbird  (1962)! | User: I just saw Casablanca  (1942) | User: And that last one was a milestone.  Boo Radley.  Scout. | User: Gregory Peck was a great actor. | Recommender: and course Titanic  (1997) is a classic!!!! | User: I'd agree that Titanic (2012)  was a worthy epic | User: I mean, the 1997 version | User: Kate and Leo | Recommender: what about It's a Wonderful Life (1946)? | User: I can recite lines from that one. | User: Zuzu's Petals. | User: Hey Bert!

Just to mix it up a bit | Recommender: Have you seen Zero Days (2016) ? | User: Zero Days?  Whats it about? | Recommender: Fascinating film about two tech employees in the Bay area who happened to discover a fatal malware created by the US government and Israeli to insert this virus into the computers of the Iranian government nuclear program and to dismantle it. However, it can operate on its own and do what it does. | User: Sounds like non-Fiction. | Recommender: Pretty much film goes on to say this malware or virus is out there and can shut down the entire continent power grid. | User: That's like something I would see.  Good suggestion.  Now I just have to find it on streaming. | Recommender: It is worth the watch. This malware is out of the box and is worst than a nuclear missile in my own opinion. | Recommender: I think Amazon should carry it. | User: I will give it a look. | Recommender: Another film is Hacksaw Ridge by Mel Gibson and it is worth the time and money. | User: I haven't seen that one either.
