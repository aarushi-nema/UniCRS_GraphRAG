I think one that is often overlooked is Phantasm  (1979) .  Some of the dialogue is stiff, but it has a unique concept and great scares. | User: Oh that sounds really good! I like good scares! Anything else? | Recommender: If you like something that is creepy, there is The Omen (1976) .  I think the original one is the best! | User: Oh I saw that! You have good taste! | Recommender: If you are in the mood for something that is more playful, there's always Creepshow (1982) .  It's a collection of stories so I'm sure there would be something in there you would enjoy. | User: No I don't like playful. Looking for something intense! | Recommender: Thank you!  It sounds like you have good taste, too.  Finally, I would suggest The Exorcist  (1973) .  Always my go-to when I want to be truly frightened.  I remember seeing the re-release several years back, being the only person in the movie theater because it was in the middle of the week when I was off, and jumping out of my skin several times because it was so freaky. | User: I really liked that movie though I watched it in the dark when I was young and made it through haha | User: Thanks a lot!!"

Do you know any good ones such as Prisoners  (2013) | Recommender: I haven't seen that one but I love Red Eye  (2005) | User: Oh wow I have not seen that one. | User: Do you know any other ones? | User: Red eye sounds very intriguing . | Recommender: One of my favorites is The Silence of the Lambs  (1991) | Recommender: I love anthony hopkins | User: Of course , that is a classic. Amazing movie , can rewatch it at any time | Recommender: My favorite genre is horror, do you have any suggestions for me? | User: I just saw A Quiet Place (2018) a couple days ago. Its more monster horror but it was still a nice movie to watch | User: Sadly , I am not a huge fan of horror so I can't really help you there | Recommender: I saw that, I thought it was an excellent use of silence in a horror film, especially for a first time director | User: Yea and it was a great thing that they casted an actual deaf girl to play the role . Makes the movie feel more real after learning that | Recommender: Yes, representation is important | Recommender: Have you seen any good comedies lately? | User: No I have not , have you . I been meaning to watch some. | Recommender: Deadpool 2  (2018) was hilarious, I would definitely recommend it | User: Oh of course that was a great movie , I personally preferred the first one tho | Recommender: One of my favorites overall is The Jerk (1979) . I also really enjoy mel brooks movies like Young Frankenstein (1974) | User: Oh thank you for the recomendations . I usually dont watch movies from the 70's but i might check it out in the future. | Recommender: they are definitely worth your time | User: Well anyway , Thanks for the good conversation. Goodbye."
22766,"Recommender: Hello! | User: Hi how are you?! | Recommender: Doing fine, and you? | User: Good thanks for asking what kind of movies do you like ? | Recommender: I tend to like things that are visually distinctive with multiple layers to work with.  I lean towards animation most of the time because of its expressiveness.  A good example would be the bleakness of Waltz with Bashir (2008), an animated documentary that just throws away objectivity and tries to recreate a war moment through the eyes of its participants. | Recommender: What do you tend to like in films? | User: Hmm that’s pretty cool I will have to check that out and pay attention to it ! | User: I like comedy and action especially Inception (2010) | Recommender: Have you seen any of the Three Flavours Cornetto trilogy ( Shaun of the Dead (2004), Hot Fuzz (2007), The World's End  (2013) )?  They're delightful combinations of genre satire and genre tributes with tight cinematography and a delightful wit, directed by the person behind Baby Driver  (2017) . | Recommender: They're quite British, but are otherwise extremely distinct and, despite not being connected in terms of story, feel like a cohesive series. | Recommender: (they also have running gags throughout, some of which are things brought up very early in the films and come back as a punchline you'd almost forget) | User: I haven’t but I will add them to my list for sure ! | Recommender: Any other films you like in particular? | User: I usually watch American films | Recommender: In that case, I can just recommend the aforementioned Baby Driver  (2017), a fun and tightly-choreographed action film packed with wit, a heist film where almost everything is in sync with the music. | User: Is it on Netflix ?! | Recommender: I'm not sure, but I can check | Recommender: not at this point, unfortunately | User: Ahhh dang no worries I’m sure I will be able to find it somewhere even the video store ! | Recommender: To top things off (and fulfill my requirements), there's an anime film from a highly-regarded director that inspired many elements of Inception (2010), Paprika  (2006) by Satoshi Kon.  It's not to everyone's taste, but it might be worth a go if you want that kind of surreal head trip. | Recommender: Unfortunately, I'm running low on time, so I'll have to stop there.  I hope that at least some of these are appealing and that you find at least one enjoyable. | Recommender: Have a good evening. | User: No problem I really appreciate your thoughts burn :)"
